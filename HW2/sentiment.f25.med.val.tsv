med_175005	It was not worth watching. I was hoping it would go in depth into unsafe bridges but it was mostly all about the Army Corp of Engineers. I did take away that the people who make up the Army Corp of Engineers are not even Engineers anymore...that was interesting. Mostly it just blamed Republicans and specifically George W Bush for the collapse of the levees in New Orleans during hurricane Katrina.	2.0	0
med_175006	We saw the first one in the theatre. I really enjoyed it. The 2nd one was okay, but the last one fell short. The change of actors were too different.	4.0	1
med_175007	Pretty good movie for a mindless diversion. Perhaps not great cinema, but it has its moments and holds your attention.	4.0	1
med_175008	My grandchildren and I enjoyed the third installment of Open Season. This movie is not just for small children, it has lots of funny parts just like the previous two movies and the love able characters are just as zany as ever.	5.0	1

med_175011	Is a good movie, a couple of jokes, good history and script, but loses essence of the series. Nadesico is genial because a lot of joke, fun and relaxation who's pass for the spectator, in same time his show a good history. The movie, however, is much dramatic and sad, definitely, this is not the face of Martian Successor Nadesico	4.0	1

med_175013	Not as bad as I expected but that's not really saying a lot. If you're a Family Guy fan, you might like it more, but I'm not a fan of that show.	2.0	0
med_175016	i love the old monster movies. i'm glad they are restoring them on dvds. package came very quickly and in good condition. great movies	5.0	1
med_175017	I enjoyed this movie quite a bit. I remember watching it and thinking I was surprised that more people hadn't seen it. The violence isn't gratuitious like the Saw movies etc but it is pretty gruesome in parts. So if that's not your cup of tea, you should probably skip this. I liked the mystery of the case and seeing the pieces come together.	4.0	1
med_175018	Not the funniest. I thought it would be a lot better. Most pub movies are really funny but not this one. Kinda a crapy story line and It makes me want to rent movies instead of buying them!	1.0	0
med_175019	Really enjoyed the movie. Can't wait to see part 2. Heard so much about the movie. Will recommend to others	5.0	1
med_175020	This was a great action movie keeps you on the edge of your seat.	5.0	1
med_175021	This is the greatest show!! Lily Tomlin is a pot smoking hippy, Jane Fonda is a straight laced yuppy, there husband's end up being gay and get married, so grace( Jane Fonda) and Frankie ( Lily Tomlin) own a beach house together, which they have no choice but to move in together, this is such a great series I can't wait for series 4 to come out in 2019!! Had no problem binge watching on Netflix, left me wanting more	5.0	1
med_175022	This came to me just like advertised, and my husband loved this gift for Christmas! The movie has special meaning to him, and having such a variety of ways to view this movie really made him happy.	5.0	1
med_175023	"I have purchased this product awhile back, because I watched the first and second film on television, and loved them. The third one was great, with a surprise ending, but I just wish they would make more. I guess the fourth on up are just in ""development hell"" (no pun intended) for the time being. Shame. Anyway, while I am no Christian I really loved this movie series, and definitely delighted in the bloopers."	5.0	1
med_175025	Watched this straight after re-reading the novel. For the most part, it sticks very closely to the novel, and covers most of its ground. An impressive version of this classic novel, it provides three hours of tense, fast-moving, and often uncomfortable viewing. Worth watching.	5.0	1
med_175026	My brother said the movie stunk. A friend said it was great. Brothers..... I like it. Sort of MechWarrior (PC game, like Battletech) vs Godzilla like monsters. Kinda corny at times, but fun. I don't regret buying it, I enjoy it. Giant human controlled robots (mechs) vs giant evil monsters. Interesting story. Very good special effects. Good science fiction, good action flick. Humanity fights the big nasty creatures. I liked it.	4.0	1
med_175027	"We all carry things...this was a beautiful glimpse into what those ""things"" are for two sisters. Raw and inspiring. Alyssa Lobit's performance and story was touching and deep. When we have an opportunity to see other people's stories, it is a very special thing. I highly recommend watching and listening to this story."	5.0	1
med_175028	My husband and I binge-watched this, I'm so glad we were able to pre-order and didn't have to leave the house to purchase it on its release date!	5.0	1
med_175029	Sadly - I could not get through the video - it did not work. Total junk.	1.0	0
med_175031	"This Director's Extended Cut is much better than the theatrical release. This version places the film in a more understandble political context in Nigeria than merely rebel troops running after ""indigenous"" personnel. The Director's cut added scenes which explains how the story unfolded as oppose to a mere military action flick in the theatrical release."	4.0	1
med_175032	Great movie for sci fi fans. Watch it over and over again. Highly recommend it. May not be good for small children as it may frighten them	5.0	1
med_175033	This movie was a little on the strange side in my opinion. Just shows how some people are control freaks.	2.0	0
med_175034	As a cowboy in a previous life, I absolutely love this series. Granted it's not for children or the faint of heart or soccer mon, but if you are a manly man or a womanly woman and love the history and excitement of the west, you'll go for this series.	5.0	1
med_175035	Be sure to look at the other offered items first. As of 1/17/13 the price on this new DVD is $85+ and used $47. Check the Blu Ray/DVD combo pack @ well under $20 New. Even if you do not have a Blu-Ray player you are much better off setting aside or selling the Blu-Ray copy. Worth checking before paying the extra $.	4.0	1

med_175047	"Great Movie. Completely different kind of normal ""action"" movies. It is about a person that almost drives crazy because he cannot believe in what he saw or what he did not see. As mentiones by others: This movie will not bring new evidence about 9/11. But it is a well made film worth watching for sure!!"	4.0	1

med_175050	It may be some people's cup of tea, but I found it so B-rated it hurt! I fell asleep about 30 minutes in and was sad that it wasn't over when I woke up. I just turned it off!	1.0	0
med_175051	Terrible ghosting/crosstalk issues--the worst that I've seen on any 3D Blu-ray release. I realize the film is 60 years old, but that shouldn't have anything to do with it. Even the 2D version has it! Very disappointing.	2.0	0

med_175071	The movie was not what we expected because the story line was not believable. The plot was much more like a video game than a movie. It was not worth the price. The part we did enjoy was the Tribute to Bill Panzer who passed away.	1.0	0
med_175072	Not as funny as I thought it would be. It was a let down.	2.0	0
med_175073	Loved this movie.. My wife and I liked the the entire series. This was a very fitting end. I do hope they don't make more. To many times a good series will get beat to death. Leave this one on a high.	5.0	1

med_175082	A great movie for boys and girls! Funny, emotional, cute, motivational...has it all. I say it's a classic in my home.	5.0	1
med_175083	Yes, it does get more than a little silly, but it has its share of memorable moments. Everyone turns in a worthy performance, the visuals are fun, and the action sequences often amusing as much as exciting. For the gaps in its storyline I should really give it 3.5 stars, maybe 3.75, but I always like watching Scarlett Johansson and I'm a fan of Luc Besson's films. :)	4.0	1
med_175084	The forces of good and evil are at again. The end of the movie leaves you wondering who are the good guys and who are the bad guys. Crime doesn't pay and in the end they find you out.	4.0	1

med_175086	"Beautiful images, seems to be very culturally accurate and relevant to several generations of Chinese persons. Humorous and at the same time touching and has deep strongly emotional themes. Great for family viewing with older ""student"" aged children and older. A must see!"	5.0	1

med_175092	"Nothing at all frightened me about this ""repeat"" of the best of the exorcism movies from way back. Well, I will say it was somewhat different in character studies than most, but the idea was the same nonsense. Giving the reader a synopsis isn't worth it. Suffice it to say don't invest your money in this turkey."	1.0	0

med_175099	At least two third of this movie is fun, teasing us with the prospects of an alien invasion and allowing us to imagine what is happening once a person is sucked by the light into an alien ship. But, lord in heaven, what were they thinking with the ending? Did they not do any audience testing? At the least, they could have left the conclusion open ended. Instead, we got the height of silliness.	2.0	0
med_175100	A disappointment and the denouement preditable. Bale and Cooper entertained from time to time. But this movie is no Amadeus.	2.0	0

med_175109	"The real reason to buy ""The Office"" on DVD is to get the deleted scenes for each episode. They contain material that was cut for reasons of time or pacing. Frequently they are very funny and give insight into events that happened in the episode that were never completely explained. Season three has three hours of deleted scenes - that is like getting an extra six episodes that were never broadcast! How can you resist?"	5.0	1
med_175111	Excellent performances, but I lost most interest after Livia and Augustus died. Later episodes more of the same with less appealing characters.	4.0	1
med_175112	Again, we see how the American society embraces and rewards our most pathetic citizens. Another manufactured fairytale ending, while completely ignoring those members of society that have worked exceptionally hard, lived healthy drug-free lifestyles, and accomplished so much more than one stinking thru-hike (and a poorly executed one at that!). Slow clap... stay classy, USA.	1.0	0

And against Adkins, no less!! The story is not that bad, the acting is not that bad...some things are not exactly great,but, Van Damme is back!	4.0	1
med_175119	"Terrible knock-off of the Cars movie. The Chinese depiction of American ""personalities"" is offensive. From the girl plane who is a pathetic flirt to the star, male plane who is an egomaniac, the characterizations are worse than stereotypes. The dialogue that goes along with is also really bad. It's only redeeming quality is that my two year old son liked watching the planes fly around. If he had been old enough to understand the storyline, I would have turned it off."	1.0	0
med_175120	"Loved the basis behind the show (Greek play, Lysistrata, which I saw as a musical production in Dallas under the name of ""Give It Up""), but just didn't finish it, due to the overuse of violence and profanity. Maybe that's the World of Chi-Raq, but it didn't work for me. Possibly, I'll give it another try down the road."	2.0	0
med_175121	"Wow! What a waste of my time. This is a remake of the original Red Dawn, starring Patrick Swayze. The original was halfway believable , as the description in IMDB says, it was ""The dawn of WWIII), where Russians invade the US. The remake has North Korea invading the US. COME ON! North Korea invading the USA! I don't think so. (unless we continue on our present decline). Don't waste your time."	2.0	0

med_175160	I like it for what it is, an edited version of the television mini series. There were several nuances missing that I was particularly looking for like the 360 degree camera rotation reflecting time passing right after Miss Eva's death. The scene that begins with Basil as a toddler and ends with him as a young man.	4.0	1
med_175162	This video is letterboxed inside a SD sized area on an HD screen. Very disappointed. Needs to be widescreen.	1.0	0
med_175163	I needed to experience the movie myself to truly understand the other reviews. The basis of the movie isn't bad and could have resulted in a great movie however it was poorly executed. The sound track to the movie is great having fun party songs and good soft background music when you are supposed to feel something, however you never feel anything. The movie relies mostly on showing off young girls and is lacking a plot/point making it very hard to watch.	1.0	0

med_175168	Extraordinary storytelling. Outlander is not some bodice-ripper romance for swooney, shut-in housewives. Yes it is romantic ,but Outlander is mature, adventurous and highly cinematic. Outlander is addictive drama of the highest order.	5.0	1
med_175169	My husband is an avid James Bond fan. He says that this was the worst Bond film he's seen. (He loves action flicks..Stallone, Segal, Eastwood but especially Bond so it must be bad. I did not see it...these are his comments.)	2.0	0

med_175178	This is a good series to watch to pass time. It is interesting. I will say I enjoyed season one much better. Season two lost me so I skipped a few episodes and went to the last few.	5.0	1
med_175179	Excellent movie. Amazon has great choices and with Prime I am finding myself going here rather than Netflix anymore.	5.0	1
med_175180	I reallly wanted to like this movie... but it was poorly acted all around and terribly shot and the story was very weak. Not sure who did the editing, but they need another go at it.	1.0	0
med_175181	Tastefully done and leaves me wanting more episodes. Binge-watched the entire series. More please! Now it makes me want to read the books in anticipation of the the series being picked up for another season.	5.0	1
med_175182	The movie itself was a good adaptation... the problem was that the Blu-ray would not play past the half way point... I can promote the movie but not the Blu-ray... Hope to see the whole movie 'on demand'...	1.0	0
med_175185	A bit contrived, but nicely implemented story about coming of age in a new environment.	4.0	1

med_175188	A really stupid movie with no plot or direction, I did watch it but by the end of the movie I was really sorry that I did, kind of glad George Clooney did disappear into space and if he is going to appear in more movie's like that one, I hope he stays there!!!	1.0	0

med_175195	Before this film I would say that I have always enjoyed any film that Colin Farrell, Rachel Weisz, or Ben Whishaw have contributed their talents to but this film is irredeemable. It is bizarre, pretentious and boring. Waste your time at your own risk.	1.0	0
med_175197	Justin Timberlake needs to stick to Saturday Night Live episodes and music. This was a waste of my TIME. Predictable and outside of the main concept the vision of the future is not very original.	2.0	0

med_175204	Batman, Batman Returns and Batman Forever are great. Batman & Robin ... big let down and cop-cat of Batman Forever. They could have done another film with more colourful villains to apologizes for B&R bad film-making. Part 5: BATMAN BEYOND?	4.0	1

med_175206	Some of the mismatched elements of this film are funny and clever. As a whole, the movie looks like a quilt of cameos, bits and unconnected ideas. Loved Danny Darko. This one is a stinker.	2.0	0
med_175207	I remember seeing it as a kid (several times) Although it lacks the sophistication of todays epics its still a lot of fun. They do actual special effects,no c g crap the picture although not perfect looksfine. The only drawback I can find is that there are no English subtitles for the original Italion (only South Korean) So you have to settle for the Dubbed English. You can't beat this version for the price.	4.0	1
med_175208	this was just a waste of time... disappointing, childish, the kind of stuff I cancelled cabel to get away from.	1.0	0
med_175209	I enjoy movies with Drew Barrymore but this movie must have had the lowest budget ever! Through most of the movie, you are not sure of the outcome. Which makes a good suspense film, again, despite the budget. The ending, well, let's say they should have ended the movie earlier as the last scenes cause the film to go from good to horrible.	1.0	0
med_175210	At first, when I received the DVD. I was excited to watch Season 2 Mako Mermaids. But they are not working for my dvd player.

med_175213	Although putting others before oneself is always the right thing to do, in everyday life the happy ending portrayed in the movie may be quite elusive. Nonetheless, the message was great and the movie worth watching!	5.0	1
med_175214	Knowing was really good. The end is kind of weird but for you religious folks out there, if you think about God making a revelation with the new world, the end is kind of like that. But you other not so religious people, its still a good movie with a weird ending.	4.0	1
med_175216	When a movie's praise is in the form of defensive reviews, rather than its own merit, you know the film has problems. A poorly written film from a great director.	1.0	0

med_175220	Whether real or imagined, this series hint to the social, political, racial and cultural intrigue that permeates the United States, most especially cities or urban centers that host sizeable populations of people of color. More importantly, Treme reveals the deep, rich cultural contributions New Orlean has bestowed upon this country.	4.0	1

med_175224	Do not buy this movie! I purchased (because there isn't a rent option) thinking it would be a fun new twist on toy Story for my 3yr old. It was literally 5 minutes of cartoon and then a bunch of creators and boring talk. Wishing I had never purchased. A complete waste of money.	1.0	0
med_175225	I got this DVD for my spouse. She liked it very much. It takes you through basic movements with a relaxing background music for atmosphere. Nice setting that promotes a no-stress workout.	4.0	1
med_175226	I ordered this from Barnes and Noble and the set is one disc on Blu-ray. It will not start to play easily. Is there a 2 disc set? Once I got it going, it proved to be best of VHS and the earlier Criterion.	4.0	1
med_175227	Great drag racing movie that catches the world of the early privateer excellently! The Willys in this film just makes your skin tingle with the though of how fun it would be to drop the hammer on. The best part is that it isn't a spit and polished movie car, the doors don't stay closed, gotta slam'em and recheck them just like a real willys. Street racing, crooked cops, money hungry promoters,almost more of a documentary of early drag racing. what more could you want!	5.0	1
med_175228	Tracy makes moves without explaining what she is doing. There is no specific order to her moves. At least if the DVD had tracks where you could choose a 15 minute lower or upper body segments, I would've stayed with her workout, but it's so haphazard that I stopped it all together.	1.0	0

med_175236	At first I want to say that I'm from Denmark, so I'm NOT good at english. Sorry for misspellings. This movie is one of the worst I've ever seen, even a 7 year-old can see it without getting scarred. It's boring, ridiculous and funny. And the funny part isn't meant good. Do not buy this movie, if you wan't to spend your money in a good way.	1.0	0

med_175242	I never though of Ava Gardener as being a great actress, and perhaps a little more make up would have made her more believable as the half caste Indian woman. Both Bill Travers and Stewart Granger giive solid performances. Perhaps because of his role, Granger gives a better performance. DVD quality is very good for a movie of this vintage. Entertaining if you like these classics	4.0	1

Otherwise, this is slow, dull, and we are never told how Spike came to be, how he knew the girl he apparently grew up with, what became of his parents, or how he can even sleep covered in all those spikes.

med_175312	Had great anticipation for a funny movie. Instead found it to be very unrealistic. Don't believe two people, so mismatched could succeed in a relationship, let alone parenting. Even stretching my imagination, which is quite good, and allowing for poetic license I couldn't accept the situation with these people and I guess missed the humor, other than very basic and predictable situations. Was a big let down.	2.0	0

med_175321	I found this version of Hamlet singularly unattractive. Acting was OK but the film lacked the context of the original play: being about a business simply belittles the story.

med_175330	I heard recently that this was a great movie, but I didn't like it. In fact, there were very few funny comedic lines. A teddy bear with a bong bangs a check out girl. I hardly laughed at all, nor did the other audience members. Frankly, I was concerned for our culture. I left before the movie was over. I just decided there were better things to do with my life.	1.0	0
med_175331	an afecienado special for all 'Biggles' fans, an absolutely impossible story that Cptn W.E.Johns, the original author would have no doubt spluttered over in the best 1920s-40s british tradition. But I loved every minute of it. Of course Biggles could fly a Jetranger copter with-out lessons, he was an accompished Sopwith Camel pilot. A seriously 'Own Boys Annual' thumping good yarn and I recommend it to all that enjoy such things.	4.0	1

I am fairly sure they took a original VHS, made a copy of it, then 3 copies of that one then transferred it to a highly compressed DVD because the quality is worse than my old Vhs copy."	1.0	0
med_175356	The science content is interesting and up to date but in terms of coming away with an idea of how to actually practice being mindful, this film leaves you wondering.

Of course the picture quality is a little low and the sound is a little rough being only because it's so old. And I just feel they don't have Bela Lugosi Onscreen enough.

med_175533	Like my title says TERRIBLE! First we see the bridge then a roof from a building then flashbacks of the devil worship and no real plot to make the movie flow real well. I know this could have been done a lot better than what was shown. I am dissappointed they gave no plot to one of America's notorious serial killers. I could watch a blue screen and be watching the same thing over and over again.	1.0	0

med_175549	Like all Leapfrog DVD's it is straight to the point with a story that does not distract the reader from the task at hand: sounding out letters, blends, learning rules for reading, etc. This DVD is for a child who already is confident and fluent at reading short vowels and perhaps some long vowel words.

med_175591	Individually, I like all the actors in this movie. But the script is just so flat and the dialog so stiff that it was painful to watch. The only redeeming thing about this move is the relationship between Carol and the pool guy. Even with that, it's not worth your time. Yeah, no. No uplifting story here unless you think watching a bunch of well-off retired 70 somethings drink too much and do too little with their lives is inspirational.	2.0	0

med_175620	Roberto Benigni took on a tough task. There have been so many movies made about the holocaust that it is difficult to add anything new to the genre, but Benigni did it. This movie wasn't about death and destruction and the evil side of human nature.

med_175642	Track of the Vampire is a silly paste job done by AIP and Roger Corman in 1964, but it works on a so-bad-it's-good level. A confusing hodgepodge of witchcraft, vampirism(attacks in broad daylight!), a house of wax, and beatniks(?!). My favorite parts involve interpretive dance (a lot of girls leaping about in a gym) and the origin of quantum painting. Jack Hill, without really meaning to, made one hell of a hooty cult film here.

med_175663	Not sure how you could just order one movie. To get the full experience you should order all three extended versions. So many details were added in the extended versions that it brings it closer to the book. As you watch the extended scenes you really have to wonder why they were chosen to not be in the theatrical version. Even if you already own the theatrical version, you really must add the extended versions to your collections.	5.0	1
med_175664	I enjoy Nicolas Cage's work and I expected to enjoy National Treasure. This Disney film is well made, but the plot is founded upon unrealistic genius: no matter how puzzling a situation becomes, Nicolas Cage always knows the answer.

med_175714	I love Gwar. I love Oderus Urungus/Dave Brockie (RIP). BUT THIS MOVIE IS TOTAL SH*T. Not even B Movie level acting. More like Z level acting. If you are thinking about buying this because Dave Brockie is in it, don't. He has a very small role in it, and then they put him on the cover of the DVD to sell more copies. Buy Hack Job instead. Or buy his book Whargoul instead.	1.0	0

med_175721	"Ok, so I do not disagree with the term ""predictable"" but that is more than counterbalanced with intense plots situations and excellent acting by Wilson, Bell and Brosnan. the kids did quite well also. My husband endured a ""rollercoaster of stress"" throughout. Yeah, this is not a documentary people, but a suspense-filled action flick that kept us on the edge of our seats. Particularly liked Lake Bell's performance as the weak, weepy turned super-hero mom."	4.0	1

med_175728	If I did not like this movie entirely, its probably because of me and my expectations. Other wise there's no reason why I shouldn't. Although I think the antagonist was a little too good to be accepted. But it's certainly different. We always expect things to turn out good at the end no matter what happens. You can argue that entertainment is suppose to make you feel good and this probably won't, but its not the fault of the story. Acting no doubt was very good overall.	4.0	1
med_175729	Yep, all the reviewers are correct. Ultraviolet will fail.

med_175734	Words can't describe how lame this movie is. Some movies can pull off a low budget and still look good, but this isn't one of them. If you saw the commercial, you literally saw every special effects shot in the movie. The story makes no sense whatsoever. The concept of vampires and werewolves fighting each other with guns is pointless. Why have monsters at all if everyone's just going to shoot at each other?	1.0	0
med_175735	I had high hopes for this after reading some decent reviews. What a shambles this film is. A decent cast all fail to provide anything worth sticking with. What a long two hours this was listening to Colin Farrell's awful Cockney accent. The story is boring and has far too much swearing, even for a gangster film. Don't bother with this. there are far better films out there!	1.0	0
med_175736	I expected bad. It was, but the actors weren't the issue.

Comparable to Ghost in the shell stand alone complex and Texhnolyze but you know what is going on. Has interesting references to Greek mythology and Blade Runner. Oh and if anyone has studied Carl Jung, his ideals are mentioned. At parts a psychological thriller, and at parts a delicious mystery. And of course action and really sexy, strong female lead.	5.0	1

With some adolescent humor mixed with a ""Dead Poet's Society"" hint (the setting, the prep school, etc.), I found myself engaged in the main characters.

med_175860	Loved the way Steve McQueen acted this, its like Mat Damon in True Grit, playing characters we wouldn't normally associate them with and doing it brilliantly - however, Tom Horn was a well meaning but slow witted man which makes this story of betrayal frustrating. Its like watching someone torturing helpless animals - might be accurate but who wants to see that? 5 stars for production and acting but 2 stars for the overall product. It simply isn't entertaining in any way but highly frustrating.	2.0	0

med_175872	Well should easily be a 5 star, but knowing Hollywood they had to make it just a touch resque when Potiphar's wife is temping Joseph. If they had left that out, it wouldn't have hurt the movie a bit and would have been a clear 5 star and probably gotten the Dove seal. Still very good and accurate as well as detailed and entertaining.	4.0	1
med_175873	This didn't go over well with the wee ones in my home at all. The older Strawberry Shortcake stories had an innocent charm that was completely lacking here. The whole thing seemed crass and the story didn't have enough ideas to sustain it through feature length. When the kids walk away before the show's over, it's a bad sign.	1.0	0
med_175874	After the third time they took the Lord's name in vain (plus a s**t bomb), about 10 minutes into the movie, we turned it off. Not suitable to watch with a 10 year old and the gratuitous profanity from Messrs. Chomsky and Gordon was not appreciated. Shirley Partridge couldn't get out a sentence without using the Lord's name in vain. What a scumbag. And Rockford wasn't much better. Sick, sick, sick.	1.0	0

med_175882	This movie was great, but I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 just because I already know so much about the case, it didn't add too much new material. But if you don't know a lot about the West Memphis 3, this is a must see. Lot of corruption going on in the state of Arkansas. Really great to see clips of the guys out of jail.

med_175886	I grew up watching the Muppet Show with my parents and watched the original films with my kids when they were growing up. Often when a cherished childhood series is revived the results can sometimes tarnish the original. This was definitely not the case with the Muppets. The movie did an excellent job of bringing the original series/films together to a new audience. This was a rare film that had me laughing out loud numerous times and also had very touching moments as well.	5.0	1

I also wrote a review of this over 6 months ago when i bought it- and my review never published. The video is very strange. I did not find it relaxing at all and it made me feel uncomfortable. The woman's outfit was strange and her breathing was too loud and seemed unnatural. Not a good work out.	1.0	0

med_175921	I am not the sort of film goer who needs stunts and car chases but I still found this film to be incredibly slow and boring. Identical twins looking grumpy and not saying anything as they walk and hitch across the countryside does not make for worthwhile entertainment. And as for it popping up in gay film recommendations, a bit of a fling between two characters for literally three minutes does not qualify this as gay.	1.0	0

med_175924	This movie is a brutal portrayal of the force of addiction wreaking havoc in th elives of four people. As the director says in his liner notes, it is because they choose to live their dreams rather than their lives.

med_175926	"This ""director's cut"" illustrates why we have film editors. I very much like Harrison's voice over on the original and feel it helps the story experience for the viewer.

med_175961	Olive Kitteridge is a truly extraordinary mini-series! Not a 'feel-good' story line, but one so steeped in the drama and (often unintentional) humor of day to day life of these characters, that it provides entertainment on the highest level. I didn't read the book, but the telling of the story on film is so richly realized, both visually and by all the actors involved--particularly Frances McDormand--that I can't imagine it would be a disappointment to fans of the book.	5.0	1

med_176003	Very typical B Movie with bad acting and no plot whatsoever.

Lots of sword play and big guns. It's a fun series, and the S.A.V.E. editions are a win-win. You get to watch great anime at a great price. Interesting plots and just plain fun. Great show. I really like this one. Well worth the price.	4.0	1

med_176047	I thought it was going to be a good movie, but it was just sort of depressing. I don't know why, but it was. I really thought it was advertised as a comedy, which it is not. I'll give it to the local library.	1.0	0

med_176054	While the film speaks for itself, the thing I wanted to point out was the DVD. The extra features are REALLY thin. The meat of it being 2 documentaries that I had already seen on cable. At this point, I would be inclined to just rent this edition and save my money for the extended edition that's coming out before Christmas. Sorry Amazon, there just no reason to spring 18 bucks to buy this when for another ten dollars I can increase my content by ten-fold ...	4.0	1

med_176079	I usually like Adam Sandler movies and thought this would be a much funnier movie. Adam Sandler is annoying in this movie, there is really nothing likable about him at all. I will never watch this movie again and would not recommend it to a friend. I was a waste of time.	2.0	0

med_176104	Another re-hash of a familiar time traveler plot, with many implausible holes in the story. Barely holds your attention, with decent acting but weak script and cheap, shop-worn, science fiction sets (check out the HG Wells Victorian-era time machine like you've seen in a gazillion movies and TV shows). I keep asking why do they keep making these mediocre movies? Are they really making a profit on them? Then again, why do I keep hoping for something that is not a waste of time.	2.0	0

med_176117	John Wick is Wickedly Entertaining. Films are so much more entertaining when manual ART is created instead of CGI. I was glued to every scene especially the fight scenes. It's obvious skill, talent, and constructive time/effort were given to the fight scenes between John Wick and anyone who stood in the way of his objective. The acting was far superior than one would expect from an action film. Kudos to everyone who worked on this film. I eagerly await John Wick 2.	5.0	1
med_176119	I have been using Tae-Bo for a while. This is the most effective 'work-out' video that I have tried. The amount of energy used is enought to get me and keep me strong and toned.

med_176126	I bought this video last December down in Branson at the Osmond Family Theater. If you are a fan of the Osmonds, you will certainly enjoy this video. As I watched this tape, the words to every song the Osmonds sang came back to me like I listened to all my Osmond albums yesterday. It's nice to see Marie on the tape as well. Donny is still my favorite Osmond Brother. As you watch this tape, don't be surprised if you start singing along with all the songs.	5.0	1
med_176127	I am a huge Tina fey fan, but it's frustrating to see her only in roles where she must choose between motherhood and career success.

med_176129	I watched the first Series episode 1 because of the high reviews and the actors in the show but it seemed to move very slow and kind of hard to keep up with.

med_176133	Definitely an interesting movie. Lots of possible theories as to what it actually means, but that's part of what makes it intriguing.

med_176159	This DVD was a real surprise. But not a good surprise. It is more like a nudist video than anything else.

med_176195	We love this dvd. We are on our second one I ordered this dvd because the first one we had was lost while we were in transit to Okinawa, Japan for our three year assignment with the Marine Corps. My son was so sad we had lost it somewhere along the way. I searched around here with no luck and found it on Amazon and the shipping was so fast and the price was so good so I got it he is still enjoying the dvd today.	5.0	1

med_176199	This movie is nothing close to Superman in any known form, The original Christopher Reeves Movie is by far better than this movie, even Superman II&III even though campy and cheesey they at least were closer to what the original stories are.	1.0	0

med_176202	Movie started off great story was thrilling...about half way through took this weird turn into this terrorist's life. I guess they were trying to humanize a cold blooded killer and let you sympathize with his irrational decisions with race and religion...Oh and his undecided relationship with a beautiful but nymph-o girlfriend... Movies overall was gay (weak) and sucked total eggs.	2.0	0

med_176218	I finally bought this DVD for lack of being able to find a place that had it for rental. It is an amazing film even if it is sad and quite violent. The film follows the lives of an inner-city Maori family and deals with issues of abuse and finding inner strength. It is certainly not a movie that everyone will like, but it is a powerful look at what people are capable of when it comes to difficult choices.	4.0	1

med_176220	I have watched this movie 4 times and each time it brings me to tears. These women what they do in order to bring peace in their village is funny and yet admirable. To me this is a well done movie, the way the story flows is beyond me. I give it 5 stars cause it touched me to the core.	5.0	1
med_176221	So amazing! I was surprised with how clean it was, as well. Not a kids movie, but definitely young adult worthy! I'm glad there are still some movies out there that aren't full of sex and language. The story was awesome, made me proud to be an American.	5.0	1

med_176232	There is no qigong secret here to build strength. In fact, this DVD has very little to do with qigong. It is mostly calisthenics. You'd have to be extremely strong to keep up with this guy, in which case, you'd already know how to do pushups. I did like the warriors nine breaths, but that doesn't make this video worth the $45.	2.0	0

med_176247	Seinfeld was the funniest show I have seen. Season 3 the show deffinately hit it's stride after 2 off an on seasons. One note to Shai Biderman, the reason the Stranded is not included on this set is because it's on Volume1. The dvd's are in production order rather than airdate order and even though the Stranded was aired during season3 it was made during season2(hence why George has a job in the Stranded)	5.0	1
med_176249	Very, very well written movie that gave me the feeling Iraq is the same today as it was in 2002! Strong characters with very clear patriotic commitments. The kind of movie our congressmen should view for the emotional effects of their decisions.	5.0	1

med_176252	Frodo actually is supposed to tackle Gollum into the volcano after his finger's bitten off? I watched the first two films and thought, hmmm, it's not true to the book but it's not TERRIBLE but Peter Jackson completely lost any hope of my being a fan of his work when he butchered the most essential part of the story-line, where the ring itself is destroyed. I'm very afraid of what's gonna happen now that Hollywoods getting their hands on Aslan as well. Yikes!	2.0	0
med_176253	While it's a television series, it's one a don't mind my son watching over and over and over again . . . which he has since I bought this for him at Christmas. Definitely getting season 2.	5.0	1
med_176254	Many of the ads in the set are unwatchable and I can't believe they were included in this poor condition - blurry and the color is all distorted. And these were the ads from the 70's! Some of the ads I saw were regional and therefore would only have been seen by people who lived in that area. There were very few that I remember and I was born in the 50's. All in all a great disappointment and I wish I had borrowed this instead of buying it.	1.0	0
med_176255	Love the twists in this time travel movie. Watched it when it came out, and just watched it again, I forgot some of the twists, it was fun to re-visit. I can't give it 5 stars, just because I wish it would have tied the pieces together a little better towards the ending.	4.0	1

med_176259	I did not like the film. It is about teen-agers who discover they have super power, but being young and thoughtless they abuse the power, and many people are hurt. There is so much they could have done with the power, and so much the writer could have done with the film, but neither did it.	2.0	0
med_176260	The movie is based on historical facts. Very good individual stories about the group in focus. They all found their inner selves through stress, pain, love and passion as individuals and teammates. James Franco was excellent, humorous and serious.	4.0	1

med_176267	I bought this thinking my 2 yr old would like it, since she loves Leap Frog. This is good for kindergartners to first grade. Definitely a little advance but she loves it anyways.

Every aspect of the series was magnificent, starting with an addicting storyline, stunning locations with awe inspiring camerawork, all the way through the perfect casting whose portrayal of their characters demands respect!!! Simply put Game of Thrones season two KICKS ASS!!!	5.0	1

med_176362	I liked it but !! , movie 4 5and6 were so much better then number 1 and 2 I am hopeing that the last movie will save the first 2 . The dwarves in the movies are not beleivable as dwarves and I though the movies were not as well acted as 4 5 and 6 , very dissapointed . Guess I was expectin to much... with that said I still will watch the 3 and last one and I hope it will be better the the first 2	2.0	0

med_176365	Ray Harryhuassen is the creator of the stop motion effects. The USA military explode a bomb on a nuclear test sight in the north pole. It unleashes a giant dinosaur called the Rhedosauras. Rhedosauras begins its destruction from east coast Canada all the way down to New York city. Great special effects, I recommend this movie to those who enjoy sci fi .	4.0	1
med_176366	Great collection of videos for the classic musical lover. Just one problem in the shipping. After it had not arrived 2 weeks after ordering, I initiated a trace. Interestingly, it arrived the next day. Watching these two screen legends dance is so very worth it.	5.0	1

med_176371	Well, the DVD is excellent to begin with the show. Although the season doesn't include the Pilot episodes (Jet Bike & Biketober) neither the Mickey special, it contains the first 13 episodes of Season One. It includes main menu, episode selection and special features. Unfortunately for people interesting in other languages, it does NOT include any subtitles(spanish,french,...), but it includes closed captions. Nice graphics, nice intros!	4.0	1

med_176373	I do not consider it to be a bonus feature to get to watch a mastercard commercial (yes, this is listed as a choice in bonus features). What is really irritating with this DVD is that you have 4 or so previews of other movies that are advertised as coming to DVD before you get to the point where the DVD will let you into the menu to start the movie. I have to fast forward through previews to get past them (I am using WinDVD on my pc).	2.0	0

Fred Astaire had the reputation for perfection so don't know what happened here. And Arthur Freed his name on a musical guaranteed a great show not this one! So save your money. I wa so disappointed.	2.0	0

med_176382	I can't believe that anyone would actually buy this. The average price for these DVD's is still around $12.00 each. It's not a deal at all. If they bring it down to $5.00 each ($150.00 total) maybe I'd consider buying it. Even if I wanted to buy it and the price was right, I already have some of these. Why would I want more than one copy of a movie?	1.0	0

med_176390	Carter Wong stars in another, could have been classic Martial arts film. A story that was slow, confusing, and action that was very choppy, and telegraphed.

med_176391	Equinox is somewhat of a minor classic, and is part of the Criterion Collection. I have no idea why, as I found it to be just as bad as a lot of the movies that have been ridiculed on Mystery Science Theater. Cheesy, and not in a good way.	2.0	0

med_176411	I really liked the first Hellsing, so when I heard about the remake I was thrilled! But this volume doesn't show any expansion on the original series, and really just felt like a waste of time. The bonus book of scenes from the storyboard is thick, but I was hoping for some more of the rough sketches. Kind of a disappointment all around. But I would recommend the original Hellsing series for anybody who likes vampire movies or anime.	2.0	0

med_176413	"Good story line with a strong start, yet get's a little ""B"" movie-ish towards the end. The front half carries it to 4 stars because 3.5 isn't available, and the quality of actors in the film definitely get it the 1/2 star node. Should have left the original title of Whisky Bay......seems a little more appropriate for a film based on a particular region."	4.0	1

med_176436	This decade later follow-up to the original Clerks movie may not carry the same indie cred that its predecessor, but it holds its own on a comedic film level. Unlike the original, this movie is more traditional in its ability to take the story to various locations thematically and literally - Clerks l was filmed in one location only. It is full of raunchy jokes and the signature Kevin Smith brand of humor we've come to know from his previous works with Jay and Silent Bob characters. The soundtrack is great too!	4.0	1
med_176437	Simply awful. Terrible script. Bad acting. Totally unbelievable. Nothing made any sense. Plot holes as big as a black hole. How anybody could give this a good rating is beyond my comprehension. I guess those who did are, unlike Lucy, only using 1 % of their brain.	1.0	0

med_176448	Two good movies. Lancaster was one of the best actors of his generation and had many great movies to show for it. Scott was also a fine actor but spent most of his career in B westerns playing the likeable cowboy. I don't think he minded it.	4.0	1

med_176487	Story line was fine but the dialog was not there! The acting was bad and characters lacked chemistry. Tyler Perry needs to slow down and produce more quality and less quantity. If you compare movies to food, this movie is McDonald's and I was hoping for a sit down delicious meal.	1.0	0

med_176496	I keep wanting to like movies with Kristen Stewart, I really do. Of all of the actors in Hollywood, I keep trying to give her credit. Unfortunately this is just another one of her flops.

med_176498	I've watched a lot of low-budget zombie films, and this is truly one of the worst. It was more a loosely connected montage of gory set pieces than a fully realized film with an actual story, and when the story does seem to finally kick in, the movie pulls the rug out from under the viewer's feet. Absolutely terrible.	1.0	0
med_176499	Too one note, after a few episodes series is predictable. Lack of nuance and acting plays too deeply into stereotypes. They behave so cluelessly. Believe a good series needs to contain one character who has a grip on reality-- the characters self absorbed. If I want self absorption I only need to step out into the world. Insults flying does not make a good series.	2.0	0

med_176508	What girl hasn't wished she could be Elizabeth and marry Darcy? It is funny how Darcy has become an icon for many girls. Lost in Austen is fun because it plays with this fantasy, and it manages not to be boring because it plays around with different possible outcomes than those of Austen's Pride and Prejudice. So for any girl who has loved P&P, this is a fascinating complimentary comedy. It is well worth a look.	4.0	1
med_176510	It was beyond predictable and the actress who played Snow White was dismal. She was stone faced, emotionless, seemed to go through the motions, and completely unbelievable to the point she overcast everyone else. My twelve year old triplets and I did not enjoy this movie.	1.0	0

med_176513	Amazon won't let me give it zero. The dialog may have been bad. I'm not sure because the audio quality was so bad I couldn't understand the dialog. The story has been told many times before and much better than this mess. there was the requisite fluttery caftan-wearing African Queen. Nothing against fluttery caftan-wearing queens, but they seem to show up in bad gay movies more for comic effect than for any contribution they make to the story. Bottom line: Skip this one.	1.0	0
med_176515	Terrible. Depressing. I can see how working on this movie would have further depressed Williams, of whom I've been an ardent fan.

One warning is the English subtitles can go pretty fast - so get your speed reading on, or pause button.	4.0	1

med_176525	There are films that really impress you when you first see them, but disappoint on subsequent viewings. This is the opposite. You might be mildly amused when you first see the movie, but you'll want to watch the whole thing. You might be underwhelmed but it will stick with you and seem better over time. I've watched it a number of times and each time, it seems to get better and better.	4.0	1
med_176526	REALLY bad ending. It's not a bad movie, but not worthy of five stars. I didn't give it three which I would deem an averagely enjoyable movie because of the ending. Watch it once, not twice.	2.0	0
med_176527	"I can't believe that this movie had such a great cast, what were they all thinking when they decided to appear in this unintelligent, stupid film. Nothing about this film was good. I don't even think little kids would enjoy this crap. It's a bad rip-off of ""Look Who's Talking."""	2.0	0

med_176533	I am not a big Drew Carey fan and the plot of this movie is not exactly realistic but watching my little boy laugh at the penguin antics was worth it. This is a cute family movie that has enough funny parts to overcome the dumb plot and unoriginal side stories.	4.0	1
med_176535	This workout depends on you being able to keep your knees bent practically the whole time, while exercising, stretching, etc. Unfortunately, bending my knees at all is painful, let alone putting stress on them while bent and trying to stay that way for 20 mins or so. Otherwise the exercises are very easy (so easy not really a workout). I would not recommend this product to a friend, especially if they have knee issues!	2.0	0

med_176539	I had to stop it about 20 mins. in. Silvermans voice is dogmatic and I couldn't feel badly for her husband or her children because they seemed aloof. The writing had a lot to do with it.

med_176541	"I was really excited to get this dvd collection but quite dissapointed once I actually popped the dvds in. There are no tutorials really that show you what/how to do certain moves ""beginners' such as myself.

med_176543	This rendition of JK Rowling's life is barely worth watching. Production value was made-for-TV quality. The acting was stiff. The story line, while easy to follow, tarried on some parts (falling in love and procreation) and zoomed through more important areas (success and publishing process).	2.0	0
med_176544	I love Diana Rigg, but this series is just silly. Poirot and Miss Marple are not violent, but are serious stories, usually, with characters who are serious and dedicated to the elmination of evil. This is more along the lines of a comedy Murder-She-Wrote. It's more tongue-in-cheek, and because it is so silly, it is hard to pay attention waiting for something to happen. My husband and I do not like the overly violent shows, but we like our mysteries to be a little bit more serious.	2.0	0
med_176545	The entire movie was about 2 very sad people, a man hw was to proud to change and a woman who doesn't love herself enough to pull away from this man after all the red flags...

med_176549	J. Nicholson's performance is obviously very good, as is the movie itself (or really any movie that won the big 5 Oscar's.) But, I, unfairly, cannot help but compare this to the glorious, glorious novel it was adapted from. I watched this just days after finishing the book, and wouldn't recommend it, as there are significant, key divergences. Still, a very, very strong piece of film	4.0	1

med_176555	Awesome in all it's campy-ness. Classic corn-ball horror-spoof that I seen when it first was released. I've been waiting for some time to get this on DVD, but was pleasently surprised to see it on here. I watched it for three days in a row.	4.0	1

med_176561	"Garbage. Stop trying to milk pointless ""reasoning"" out of a perfect, original, and simple premise. All this movie does is try to make sense and take all the mystery out of Cameron's original masterpiece. The Terminator used to be a terrifying premise. This is a joke. Poor Jai Courtney...decent actor who can't catch a break with a decent movie. And Arnold, you are done. Go take a nap."	1.0	0
med_176562	Almost stopped watching it because it was hard to follow with very choppy editing. Yes the horses were pretty but so unrealistic. Nobody leaves horses tied in stalls all the time. It is inferred in the beginning that neither her or her dad ride yet they both seem to know how to perfectly tack up a somewhat complicated setup and then ride beautifully especially when Claire rides Fandango who hasn't been ridden since his accident. Even the 9 year old horse crazy girl I watched it with pointed out these issues.	1.0	0
med_176563	I waited a long time to see this movie. What I got was cliche's and product placement. The critics were right to savage this piece of warmed over science fiction pap in their reviews.

med_176564	Just a re-hash of her first special Jesus Is Magic, but she strives - and succeeds - to be even more offensive in this offering. Shocking, offensive, startling, stunning, etc. may work the first time around but with no new angles it's just - I don't know - boring.

The characters are interesting, there is suspense, drama, and all around awesome zombie killing.

In short, everything that science explains is part of God's plan.	5.0	1

med_176697	A great movie on Roman History & how one man, whom was dedicated to Rome, after losing everything that was good in his life, carries on to win the hearts of the many in defiance of one. A fantastic movie that you will watch more then once.	5.0	1
med_176698	The show kept pausing -- saying there were internet issues and to watch at a later date. We had our grandkids over so there was no watching at a later date. Our internet worked fine with everything else we use it for so not sure what the deal was here. But we lost our money and the kids were frustrated. Bad experience	1.0	0
med_176699	Average. For someone who has never done step it moves very very quickly. Also found it confusing when the instructor didn't say they were heading left or right as because you are watching it on TV it is all back to front so can be tricky and easy to get out of sync.	2.0	0
med_176701	I found the entire collection to be slow moving and dated. It was nice having Giannaris introduce each film. Without his introduction, I think I would have been terribly lost.	2.0	0
med_176702	Terrible CGI, horrible plot, and so many different plots that never really develop into anything. I had really high hopes and I really wanted this movie to be good....... TLDR: If I had paid $0.01 to watch this movie, I would want my money back.	1.0	0

med_176710	The dvd was not harmed but when I received it in the mail the box was broken and un usable. Even the plastic sleeve and paper insert was torn. Otherwise i would give it five stars instead of two. I had to purchase a separate case to put the DVD in.	2.0	0

med_176718	An excellent story and take on Columbuse's life but I was barely able to watch the movie and found lots of problem with sound and images in another word this product is very oudated for today's technology. I hope they digitally re-mastering it. it worth all the effort.	2.0	0

med_176721	The story is good. However, the movie is old and uses old resources and technology. My daughter read the book series and watch the latest version of the movie (Tim Borton's) and then she wanted so watch this 1950's version. She lost interest immediately. The dialogs, songs, and scenes are outdated, in my opinion. I remember have seen this movie when I was a kid and I kind of liked it. But not anymore, when I tried to watch it recently.	2.0	0

med_176724	The sixth season of Wings was undoubtedly its best and the DVDs shos that. However, the quality of the DVD package leaves something to be desired. To save money, the distributors has inserted the DVDs over the episode summaries so that you have to clumsily remove them to read the summaries. Further, there are no extras yet again as in the previous season collections. Finally, visual quality seems murky at best. Buy this season for the funny, endearing characters and try to forget about the cheapo packaging.	4.0	1
med_176726	Enjoyed the acting, scenery and drama. Interesting conjecture about what might have happened to princes in the tower. Slow going in spots. Costuming not accurate for the time. No wimples. Overall, very good historical fiction.	4.0	1

med_176730	This was a real mess of a war movie. It didn't know what direction it wanted to take. The messages common: war is bad, it's hell, it changes you, why does the system do this to man, etc. But really poorly. Casting, direction, music, all had no direction. It wanted to make a statement but didn't know how. Way too slow. A real disservice to the viewer. Don't bother.	2.0	0

med_176771	Tom Hardy is a perfectly cast as Max. The War Boys, Immortan Joe, the Vuvalini are perfect. Charlize Theron's accent, or lack of, made her a less than perfect Imperator Furiosa.

med_176772	"Magnum was one of the better programs of the '80s, and in spite of the occasional trite plotline or cliche, it's still worth watching. Unlike Jim Rockford of ""The Rockford Files"", Magnum can actually defend himself and doesn't constantly allow himself to be made a fool of. John Hillerman's character, Higgins, keeps things from getting too silly or melodramatic, and adds a note of dignity to the cast."	4.0	1

med_176780	These ALF DVD sets are cut-up with many favorite scenes missing from the original TV airings. These are the poor syndicated versions with 4-6 minutes cut out of every show. With a show being only 24 minutes minus commercials you can imagine what your missing. Sometimes 1/2 the plot is gone. Note this is on all 4 ALF DVD sets. Save your money for the UN-CUT versions to be made. Until then Mugawi will be waiting!	1.0	0

med_176807	For me this is such a great movie. Yes, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck did a wonderful job making it and won an Oscar for it but the whole movie is so memorable. So many lines to quote, tears to be shed (you know the part with Robin Williams and MD where they hug and get all emotional). I had to have it for my collection.	5.0	1
med_176808	I'm in love with Rosamund Pike. She just doesn't know it. This movie didn't do much for me, I guess you have to be a British movie buff and I've not. Long and drawn out with focus on divorce.	2.0	0
med_176809	Not a lot happens in this film, nothing is resolved, and it leaves you hanging at the end. Felt more like a setup for a series. It was terribly voice acted. The WORST thing about the movie is that they splice in scenes of live action actors talking about random crap that, while kind of relevant to the over-arching story, is benign to the plot. Horrible film.	1.0	0
med_176810	The last, best season for the show. The pinnacle, before the plateau and the inevitable fall, starting with season six. Though season 1 is by far the best, many episodes here waivered from classic to the quirky of humbug. What's better than to kick a season off with an episode penned (uncredited) by the great shadowman Richard Doty? All around good season, least favorite episode I Jose Chung's, although it is a fan favorite for some reason. It took quirky too far, IMO.	5.0	1
med_176812	Bought it for mom's birthday,delivery was quick,DVDs were excellent shape (no scratches or broken),would be nice to see the other seasons come out on DVD!!! Would recommend to anyone interested in the unknown & unexplainable from this classic!	4.0	1

med_176824	I gave this 2 stars because the fight scenes are good. As for the rest well the story had potential but plummeted to nothingness. Characters didn't evolve. The love between the new couple felt forced. Eventually the movie just drags along to a weird ending.	2.0	0
med_176825	I watched this as a kid and really loved it. It's campy, but decades later, I still love watching it. It's a fun movie that doesn't take itself seriously at all. Not all versions have subtitles, so check for that specifically if it's of interest to you.	4.0	1

med_176829	This movie is ridiculously funny! Jonah Hill is one of my favorite up and coming comedians. Its like a modern day Adventures in Babysitting (a classic)and instead of playboys and thor look alikes its got drug dealers and a misunderstood trio of kids, one of which can't help but to blow things up! Definitely didn't regret watching this movie!	4.0	1
med_176830	This was a lot better than we expected. We never saw it in the theater so we were skeptical but we really enjoyed it! It answers a lot of questions about the background of the Xmen and it kept our attention the whole time. I would totally recommend it!	4.0	1

med_176848	Heart of the Golden West is a very poor transfer - washed out and a ghost image almost like you are watchign an old TV with an indoor antenna. I consider this unacceptable for a DVD. On the other hand, Come On Rangers is of better quality (though not excellent) and if this is the only film you care about ,it is worth while. The 2 stars are for Heart of the West.	2.0	0
med_176849	Brilliant. One of those rare movies and stories that sems to have every aspect of the heart's facets worked into the piece. You know how sometimes you can just get wrapped up in a great serious, thought-provoking story so much that when there's the slightest simple joke you burst out laughing ten times more than you would for a comedy? Maybe that's just me, but this movie hits that quality level and so much more.	5.0	1

med_176857	This poor guy had real problems. Watching a couple of minutes of his home movies were enough to convince one of that fact. It seems that any of his 'friends' could have intervened to get him off his delusion death wish. Strangely, all the other people interviewed, friends, former lovers, coroner -- as had the same zombie-ingenue aura, so maybe they felt the Grizzly Man was perfectly normal. As a movie, it was a home movie.	2.0	0

Each version I had previously purchased had been a clear upgrade in quality from past versions, and I was so excited to see the original theatrical versions (as they should be seen)finally available on DVD. Sadly, the picture and sound quality on this is worse than my VHS versions from the 80s. This set is a total rip off and George should be ashamed of himself.	2.0	0

med_176971	Ray Milland is wonderful in a melodramatic turn in an Alfred Hitchcock film made in 1954. It is based on a stage play and feels like it is designed for the stage. The plot and twists are good but maybe not Hitchcock's finest in my view. Entertaining and engrossing. I like that it feels like a trip to a London theater while viewing it as that heightens the experience. I think it definitely should be viewed as a period piece and a part of Hitchcock's vast collection of fine mysteries.	4.0	1

It is definitely superior watching and deserves kudos in all areas: writing, acting, directing and production.

med_177014	Solid if unspectacular Uk low-budget action film. My biggest problem with this film was it's lack of scope. For a short film (it's only just 60 mins long) it has a cast of less than 5 or 6 and often looks like it was shot in the film makers bedroom. This isn't to say that it has it's moments. Steve Lawson's fight with Wyndham and Chris Jones is pretty good but the whole thing just feels pretty small.	2.0	0
med_177016	This DVD is ridiculous. The price is ridiculous when you consider that it has a sum total of TWO episodes on it.

The DVD cover case is very poorly made with the cheapest materials possible, and the DVD itself rattles around inside the case, because it was not made to fit properly inside. Highly disappointed. You'd do better to find a torrent online and download it, rather than buy this junk.	1.0	0

med_177023	I stopped watching this movie after the ambulance scene. I had seen enough. The scariest thing about this cartoon of a movie? THAT IT EVER GOT MADE! Also scary is that the hollywood crowd gets lauded for this goreification, and that legions of people apparently enjoy this kind of stuff. Ooo blood, ooo peeled skin, ooo stinking rotted corpses. This film is great, if you're a maggot.	1.0	0

med_177027	complete with LA Lakers joining the CalSci basketball team this season is close to Charlie's Angels in intelligence, plot, and character development. The secondary characters are boring and uninteresting. The stories border on silly. The writers seem so interested in forcing internal nuance onto the characters they didn't bother to actually create interesting stories or cases. This was the 'jump the shark' season for a series that was at least interesting in previous seasons.	1.0	0
med_177029	Quick and simple review: Bad acting and I mean really bad acting. The plot was okay but a little over the top.	1.0	0
med_177030	It kicks off well enough, and held my attention for a bit. But this movie just falls apart right in the middle and the ending just felt rushed. Maybe if it had spent less time with building the boring plot, it could've been something decent or memorable. The over the top gore was entertaining, but when it gets to the middle of the film, the horror stuff subsides and the romance completely takes over and that's where it became a borefest. Nothing special.	2.0	0
med_177031	Not too bad. They did the same thing with this one as they did with the Annabelle doll. They should have kept the doll looking the way it actually does. Innocent looking things reeking havoc are much scarier. The ending doesn't fit, but the rest of the movie, I thought, was enjoyable.	4.0	1

med_177045	Tom Hardy did an excellent job selling the character. In terms of artistic value, this movie is amazing. If you're looking for an interesting and 'must-watch' movie, I would say this is not the one. Consider it a single environment, 90 minute conference call. As far as phone conversations goes, he's had some of the more interesting ones I've heard... but that doesn't necessarily mean I want to watch a feature length film about it.	2.0	0

med_177056	I am an avid fan of Tamilee's workouts, but this one is not one of her best. I found the moves difficult to follow and not as physically challenging as choreographically challenging. I finished the workout frustrated and feeling that I hadn't really had a very good workout. The Tighter Assets for Weight Loss is a much better workout. This one was disappointing.	2.0	0
med_177057	Scenery was beautiful. Bears are magnificent. I found myself feeling sad for the bears and the lack of respect shown to them by this man. His story is one of arrogance and not respect for wildlife. Though his death is sad it could not have been unexpected. I do not feel that he accomplished anything for the benefit of the Grizzly Bear. Instead the bears that he encountered may have been put in danger due to his carelessness.	2.0	0

med_177145	From the more pensive, less action-packed episodes to the devastating chapters where we lose beloved , Season 5 carries on in its tradition of in-depth character development and story lines. Many complain when the series spends too much time on delving into the survivors' heads and building up the plot instead of bombarding us with constant bloody zombie-action. Thankfully, the writers know better and stick to their guns. They know how to keep such a unique series exciting and insightful for so long!	5.0	1

The author didn't give the young adults any credit for intellectual reasoning. I have read many young adult books that were handled much better.	2.0	0

med_177188	When I saw that this was coming out, I was really looking forward to it but now that I have it, I'm completely dissappointed with it. If you've seen Family Guy or own all of the seasons, you've seen most of this dvd already. It has a few new clips but it's definitely not worth the money. It would've been better as a bonus dvd added in with the Family Guy seasons.	2.0	0

med_177193	Ridiculously badly acted, especially by the lead actress playing the role of the mother. The movie amounts to nothing more than incompetent actors screaming and ranting.

med_177202	....but if not, you won't. Watching lip-synched remakes of classic rock and roll tracks was pretty revolting. Fact that they were allegedly sung by the the stars of the movie made it even worse. I will have a hard time listening to the real tracks without remembering how awful the Rock of Ages remakes were. Rented it because my wife is a Glee fan. I think she'd give it 2 or 3 stars.	1.0	0

med_177265	2012 Doomsday is funny for all the wrong reasons. On the surface, it's an apocalyptic horror movie, but it spends a lot of time on religious discussions.

Add to this bad acting and special effects and you get a movie that is unintentionally funny, sometimes hilarious. Recommended for those who love bad movies.	2.0	0

The plot and timeline were fragmented and hard to determine whether this was before, during, or after the original story. The acting was stiff, and the actors were not helped by the complete failure of the screenwriters to come up with any compelling dialog or storyline.

med_177292	This is the consummate chick flick. Based on true events it reads like a campfire story for the romantic notions of love without boundries.

med_177343	Not either of their best movies, but the acting was well done. Weird movie overall.	4.0	1

med_177345	Could have been a good combat documentary, but isn't. Instead, it starts leaning towards being a half-baked Hollywood movie. I hope someone uses all the raw footage and cuts it to make something more decent. Something that narrates the true experiences of combat. Get someone who was among the mission leaders of those operations.	2.0	0

med_177354	Strange what writers chose to focus on. Most of it is shear fantasy. Hitchcock haunted by the idea of Gein? His jealousy over the possibility Alma might be having an affair? No mention of Bernard Herrmann? No mention of the Hitchcock's daughter, who had a role in Psycho? Jessica Biel as Vera Miles???? This movie could have been so great. I give it a 2 only because they did create some scary moments when referencing Gein's crimes and discussing Bloch's book.	2.0	0

med_177362	"This movie was very weird overall. I thought it would pick up at some point but it never did and there were several scenes that were not only weird but that were also almost ""uncomfortable"".

med_177366	Excellent Direction and Acting on the Social-Economic Issues in pre WW1 years in Scotland, and resulting impact of various factors that affect a close knit family and friends during the initial years of that war. This is based on the book of the same name and similar to anti-war movies of various eras. the scripting could have been better. The setting and music are appropriate.	4.0	1
med_177367	I believe that this DVD is worthy of the creators of Final Fantasy itself. In essence, the movie is leaps ahead of its own time, and it does the Final Fantasy franchise just as much justice, if not more, than the games themselves. Combine out-of-this-world graphics with a killer soundtrack and a kick butt star- studded lineup of actors, this is the one to buy.	5.0	1

med_177369	Amateurishly directed and acted. Flat and boring. Inexpert acting on a measurably lower level than any number of high school productions. The actors appear to be reciting memorized lines, and appeared unable to transmute their canned dialogues into anything resembling a conversation. The boring dialogues and subsequent uninspiring delivery makes the whole thing boring and a high-effort exercise to follow. Advice? Don't waste your time.	1.0	0

I already have this movie preordered and am counting down the days until it ships!!!"	5.0	1
med_177371	I bought Vol. 1, and would pay immediately for the rest of the series, but for one thing: the problem with the music has not been handled to anyone's satisfaction. For now, I'll stick to VHS converted to DVD, and that's a shame. Please try and get it right, CBS.	1.0	0

med_177381	Not worth all of the Oscar hype AT ALL. I mean, it was an interesting movie, but it was not as fast-paced as I had hoped...in fact, it was even a little boring in parts.

med_177389	"I agree with the other one star reviews. I can handle dark comedy. I actually like it.

I was hoping for more Norm Snead, Sonny Jurgenson Sam Huff and Bobby Mitchell than was supplied but overall this is an excellent history of the team. The NFL history formula is grossly overproduced but even making the fullest allowance for some of this cringe-worthy production, the history gives a great feel for the Redskins and their relationship to the city of Washington DC	4.0	1

med_177434	No recording of Le Nozze di Figaro would ever get less than 5 stars from me unless the singers were sadly out of tune. This performance certainly has no such flaw; the singers are splendid and vocally suitable to their roles. The sets are charming. The stage action is gracefully theatrical. This is an extremely well-balanced ensemble of music, theater and visual art. Other performances may include more enormous vocal talents, but few could be more enjoyable.	5.0	1
med_177436	"The ending ruined the movie, in my opinion. It did not at all fit the theme of the rest of the story line. If we had a ""choose your own adventure"" option, I would have picked a different ending and then I would have maybe liked it.. too many details in some areas, too much left to the unknown in others. Was a psychological thriller up until it became a sci fi movie with a bad ending."	2.0	0

med_177501	I went through all the processes on this DVD and my TV picture was no better than it was before with the Vizio HDTV's automatic picture settings. Unless you have an HDTV that does not have good 'auto' picture settings, I think this DVD is a waste money.	2.0	0

med_177503	"Truly moving, particularly his ""get it out of my system"" night of self-harm and, ultimately, purification through sex. The 'apartment prostitutes' visually almost like women embalming Christ's body. Some unforgettable visual and emotional scenes. Yeah, so he's naked.. in context & not the point until his double life starts cracking and he has to face walled-off parts of himself. Great flick & fantastic cast gave it their all. Not a lightweight movie. Suicide attempt & blood TW."	5.0	1
med_177504	I would rather give no star, but seriously? Director from the movie must of called friends to do reviews because NO ONE would think this is a good movie. It's awful. It starts with 5 minutes of flash clips that make no sense. Im confused. Watched 11 minutes and it still ruined my night.	1.0	0
med_177506	"This is the 16th Pokemon movie, and the final in the ""Black & White"" series. Like all Pokemon movies, this one is one of the best movies, ever. Mewtwo's appearance in the film is what the audience (that would be you and me, and others) wanted to see. Great film to see!"	5.0	1

med_177519	I thought it was just another T&A flick. Then it had so many plot twists and turns. They tied it together in a tight little package in the end. (Well Done)	4.0	1
med_177520	It follows the book very well. The explanation of the plot was a little oversimplified but made sense. By far the most violent and graphic of the DCAO movies, this is not for the younger viewers. I've watched this movie repeatedly since it arrived. If nothing else, watch it for Batman. He's even darker than normal.	5.0	1
med_177521	"I like this movie. It's why I decided to buy it. I chose to buy this particular version of this movie because it (supposedly) included a digital version. Obviously, you've concluded from the ""supposedly"" in the previous sentence that it doesn't come with a digital copy. You're correct. It doesn't. Grrrr!"	1.0	0
med_177522	This movie is less than par, in fact not even sub par. Leave it to disney to ruin a timeless classic such as this story. The animation is very very poor, the acting is regrettable, and the sound and picture quality are that of an old worn out tape.	1.0	0
med_177523	5 minutes into this movie, there was a woman with her breasts hanging out trying to get some action. I'm not impressed. We rented it because we like scary movies.

It's a very difficult movie to find, however; HBO ran it once (I think), then it was gone. Netflix doesn't list it anymore, either. I found it on Amazon and Redbox. I believe that the movie doesn't have a distributor, which may explain why it's scarce. Definitely worth finding and watching!"	4.0	1

Several ""actors"" sounded like they were reading their lines and the casting was terrible. I wondered if this was a spoof but realized that the whole movie was just really BAD. I bet the actual story was good but this movie was a waste of time. I really didn't even get a good laugh out of it."	1.0	0

med_177544	"This movie has ""curse words"" peppered throughout the movie, one especially at the very end of the cowboys ""bunkhouse scene"", that I don't want my children (or myself or my wife) having to listen to.

med_177558	I heard about this documentary quite a while back, but I didn't know the names of it or the man whose life is highlighted by it. Browsing through Prime, I was so happy to find it. The artist was interesting and his motive was the challenge rather than profit.	5.0	1

Set in beautiful Sicily, Sylvo solves crimes involving all levels of society, despite the opposition from mafia, church and bureacracy.

med_177564	I love this movie, it's very well done. The frustrating part is having to pay $3.99 to simply rent the movie and only have access to it for 24 hours after beginning the film.

I don't plan on renting a movie again from Amazon, the prize doesn't seem to be worth the length of time.	4.0	1

med_177673	"It moved a bit slow at times (as many historically based films do). Overall, pretty true to the historical facts. Don't know how one critic could call it, ""mesmerizing"". I enjoyed the story and the acting and direction were good."	4.0	1
med_177674	I love horror movies and even terrible horror movies. B and C and D movies that know they are what they are. This is a D movie that thinks it's an A movie and the result is complete suck. All of the characters suck and trying to pay attention to what is happening will just give you a headache. I'm bitter about the 4.99 I spent to watch this.	1.0	0
med_177675	Awful, simply awful. Save your money and get something else. The cover art is a BIG LIE as the creature depicted in the art NEVER appears in the movie. Horrible plot, chessy effects and little or no clarity about what the hell is supposed to be going on. Again another crotch-stain of a movie that ruins H. P. Lovecraft's name. Shame on you LionsGate Films for even releasing this piece of excrement.	1.0	0

med_177685	"After seeing this film, Disney's decision to purchase Pixar was a very good deal. If this is the best Disney computer animators could do, they were in a heap of trouble. NOTE TO DISNEY - Leave the computer animation to Pixar, or at least the story line and voice casting. While the animation was fair, the story was lame and similar to Madagascar. And I really like Kiefer Sutherland in ""24"" but he wasn't that great as the Father Lion."	2.0	0

med_177697	Saying that this movie is slow would be an understatement. Molasses moves faster. I'm usually a bit leary of films written and directed by the same person and in this case I was right to be. Somehow I managed to watch the first 40 minutes without completely falling asleep. After that I started fast forwarding. As one reviewer said, it's an interesting concept done with very poor execution.	1.0	0
med_177698	if you like lots of gore in a mutant smashing zombie thriller, this is the one.

med_177703	This movie is alright. It gets you involved in the storyline and makes you become aware of the exotic time and place. Jessica Alba was SUPERB. Mastering the language and blending into the Sarawak village; she can act! This is a must see for Jessica Alba fans. Maybe a lot for the guys to see a little somethin' somethin', but also for the girls to get lost in the love story between Jessica and Hugh Dancy.	4.0	1
med_177704	Watch for the story, maybe, there's one there. But you won't see a lot of disaster at all, and what you get is poorly done. A really good disaster movie with good special effects and plenty of havoc/nature's fury doesn't need the best story. It depends on one's tastes. If I had to pick, I'd take the good disaster movie with little story. I did not get that here. A couple tornados and they were really poorly done. Uggh.	2.0	0

The kid is a Bob Dylan look alike, his story is directionless (and that is supposed to be the beauty of it), which would be fine if this movie went anywhere, but it ends in the worst possible way-- almost as if they ran out of budget and had to just end. Waste.of. Time.	2.0	0
med_177721	This was an incredible disappointment. I don't honestly recommend it if you were a fan of the original series.

If you are looking for general system introductions (30 min) in an easily digestible format veiwable for high school or college level students I would reccomend the Body Atlas series, published by TLC. If you want indepth lectures (45 minute segments) on each system I would recommend Understanding the Human Body with Anthony Goodman published by The Teaching Company.

med_177777	The movie was much more violent than I expected it to be for an animated Justice League movie, showing an open heart, some blood, and plenty of people dying. I wish there had been some more development on how the Batman came to be the way he was and I was a little disappointed that there wasn't really any investigation into the Joker besides a close-up of some Joker cards with laughter in the background. The whole idea of Amazon and Atlantis being at war with each other was pretty interesting, too.	4.0	1

med_177825	These films have been previously released on the blu-ray format, but the audio was DolbyDigital 5.1. With this new release, many of us were hoping that theses films would be released in lossless, HD audio. Sorry to say, but apparently Warner Bros.'s re-release has the same lossy audio as the first release. The only thing new is the fourth disc with extras, a pair of dice, and a deck of cards. Maybe next time?	2.0	0

med_177836	I never bought this as far as I know, not even for my left wing, bleeding heart sister. How the hell did this end up on my items to review? God, this was a BS contrived show that violated most of the logical fallacy rules and lent it self to an idealist portrayal of a very flawed political view point. If i did ever order this it was not something I can recall. Save your money and read a book about the presidency.	1.0	0

med_177838	Lame adaptation of the beloved Ken Follett novel is redeemed only by Matthew Macfayden's performance as the persevering Brother Phillip, who somehow maintains a steadfast dignity in the face of unadulterated silliness. The usually reliable Ian McShane labors beneath risible hair and seems to give up on it all about midway through. Otherwise, a bunch a pretty, indistinguishable young actors (none of whom age a bit) sport 21st Century orthodontia and blunder about England slaying and betraying. Thin mortar, this.	2.0	0
med_177839	did not like it i found it very inaccurate i brought the dvd thinking it was about manfred von richtofen instead it is more of a love story i have since purchased von richtofen & brown in the hope this is the dvd i was looking for if you really want to learn about the red baron try the book RICHTOFEN by william e burrows	2.0	0

med_177850	Skip it. We were bored and decided to try watching this. I wish I had saved my money. Horrible acting and cheesy special effects. The storm takes place in a small town in Texas that just happens to have a major airport??

med_177859	"Terribly boring movie with bad, black and white, choppy footage. The story is a bit ridiculous, blood thirsty creatures on the moon. It seemed like another zombie movie, basically. They could easily just call this movie Quarantine 3 and get away with it. It might have been better if they didn't try to make this a ""found footage"" movie. Watching bad quality, black and white, choppy scenes wasn't pleasant and it takes down my rating quite a bit."	1.0	0

The jokes aren't funny, the action, if you can call it that, is boring. The only thing that could have saved this movie would have been nudity, and there isn't any. This movie is a complete waste of money, they should just throw it in the garbage and hope everyone forgets about it.	1.0	0

med_177873	A really engrossing drama with a great sense of humor as well. The concurrent storylines are challenging to keep up with, but not overwhelming. Plus it's amazing watching Tatiana Maslany create several fully fleshed-out & believable characters. I'm probably going to get the box set when the series concludes.	4.0	1
med_177874	Definitely a must have for all die hard collectors. Style is refreshing and content is original. Rock Fresh is hands down one of the best urban documentaries if not one of the best urban films. Director's style is a standout and really engages you as if you were right there behind the lense. Highly recommended.	5.0	1

med_177880	I read the book and loved it. It is not a traditional happy ending, but it provided enough for one of the main characters to figure out what real happiness looks and feels like. The movie gives the audience something they want - restoration of love lost. Although this wasn't a part of the original text, it still works and provides a moving story.	4.0	1
med_177881	I think I would enjoy watching Johnny Depp watch paint dry. His characterizations are always scene stealing.

med_177898	If the lead actor was anyone other than Ian McKellen, this movie would not be given such high acclaim. It is not a good movie.

med_177988	One of the only movies where Redford plays a character whose morals are questionable, and he comes off slightly unlikeable. Made up for by the brilliance of the progression of the central theme through a loosely 70s-style plot. One of my favorite movies of all time, and firmly in my collection. Along with other Redford greats like The Milagro Beanfield War, The Way We Were, Brubaker (swoon) and The Last Castle.	5.0	1

med_177993	A lot of viewers are looking for cheap thrills and chills. Mr. Jones delivers none. However, thoughtful plotting, dialogue, and exploration of where art and dark forces come together, with loving camerawork, make this film well worth viewing for the connoisseur of dark surreal literature.	4.0	1
med_177994	This little documentary paints an extraordinarily vivid picture of what it would be like to undergo Hurricane Katrina's wrath. It is extremely well paced, allowing the viewer to full absorb the shocking images of devastation. But it also touches on the complicated relationship between fathers and sons. The Vietnam vet survivalist father is a fascinating character, especially in how he seeks to mold his sons. I only wish the film were longer so that we could explore this relationship more.	5.0	1

med_178000	This film never really engaged me. The plot in a nutshell is earthy peasent teaches life lessons to uptight Brit. Anthony Quinn could have gotten a patent playing these earthy (name the ethnicity) foreign types. Alan Bates plays the stiff upper-lipped Brit. Throw in a dying French prostitute for a little melodrama. The story just meandered if it wasn't resorting to well-worn cliches. Two pluses for the movie is the gorgeous black-and-white cinematography and a great music score.	2.0	0

med_178024	My children and I enjoyed the movie for the most part with the animals actually looking like animals. But, we were all quite disappointed and a little bit disgusted that the movie makers once again had to put something in that didn't belong and wasn't even needed. I am referring to the budding romance between Susan and Prince Caspian. Please! Why was that necessary. Why do children's movies have to fill the need that adults have for sexual undertones (or overtones for that matter)	4.0	1
med_178025	This is a heartbreaking yet cute story of a woman still in love with her dead husband, who left behind a series of letters and missions that he wants her to accomplish. Of course, life continues, and there are friends and family and other men for her to deal with at the same time. It's rather predictable, I suppose, but nice to watch for the locations in Ireland, as well as for Butler, Bates, Morgan, and Swank.	4.0	1

med_178037	I saw this movie when it came out. I knew back then it was a load of crap. The author of the book it's based on is a fraud.

med_178041	This movie was a last minute choice after searching for something all of us were interested in. As it turns out, the story and animation was worth the every moment. The time we spent watching was filled with silence as there were no groans from anyone about why did we have to watch this movie. I would watch again without hesitation.	4.0	1
med_178042	"I am speechless. It was a sacrifice to watch 30 minutes of it. I gave up. It has no argument, sense, or storyline. A hopeless nonsensical parody.

med_178053	I also feel ripped off after buying this DVD. The John Wu-like incessant gunplay adds nothing to this movie. And Swartzenegger takes himself way too seriously in a poor imitation of the Harrison Ford/Blade Runner role. The special effects are okay but nothing to write home about. Wait for this to come onto network tv where you will be spared the gratuitous foul language and sex scenes... and not have to waste your money to see it!	2.0	0

med_178111	I found it so disappointing to find this movie called Mansfield Park and its total disregard of Jane Austen's book. Any resemblance to the novel is by accident.

med_178157	"This show feeds the desire to go against the physical faculties of our body created to procreate. Society has compromised by creating a ""Do it if it feels right"" mentality. Immoral behavior feels right too, but it is still wrong. In my book, wrong never has a grey area!"	1.0	0
med_178158	Forget the skating and the plot, for me the best part of the film is the musical speciality number, 'War Dance of the Wooden Indians', which features rare footage of Raymond Scott & his Quintette. Of particular interest and note is Scott's highly talented drummer, Johnny Williams, the late father of John Williams, the movie theme composer ( 'Star Wars', etc.). Pure magic.	4.0	1

med_178160	It's action packed and bears only a slight resemblance to the original movie. The ending didn't make much sense though after the final twist. However, if you liked the original movie you should enjoy this one too. It's well worth watching.	4.0	1
med_178161	I deducted one star for the lack of menus and extras. Some of these are unavailable at any price, and actually are of good video and audio quality. I would love to have Prospero's Books remastered and released on Blu-ray, but what are the odds?	4.0	1

med_178171	This set of DVD's is very well done once you start watching them. The writing and cast are still excellent and the picture is really fine. But it was packaged with an episode guide, which the earlier seasons have. I had to go to Amazon's page, copy the episodes from there, and print them so I could put them inside the case. I didn't realize this was partially a do-it-yourself kit! I'm still glad to have it available, though.	4.0	1

med_178198	Why is the DVD version in Full Screen 1.33:1 format and Blu-Ray is in Widescreen 1.85:1? It appears that this is a new way to force DVD obsolescence and move everyone to Blu-Ray. That really annoys me. As for the series, it is very elementary, although enjoyable to watch. I would prefer more animation and less interview and real-world examples as this is really aimed at the simple minded.	2.0	0

med_178204	Not bad early 70's Spanish-Italian made, English-dubbed horror film. A group of weary travelers gather at a spooky isolated mansion and start getting picked off one by one. Is it ghosts, monsters, or murder? The Substance DVD release is OK quality, but it needs re-mastering. Not much in the way of extras. Recommended for fans of the genre.	4.0	1

med_178220	I don't care for most horror films except for a few from the 1930's and 40's. Most horror films today are little more than slice and dice butchery videos.

It is still little more than a zombie flick - but one that shows craft.	4.0	1

med_178231	Wow. Even for being a non-Christian/Catholic, the premise behind 'Stigmata' is riveting.

med_178234	This DVD package was a disappointment: it contained no printed insert - not even a track list. The English sub-titles are completely incompetent: bad punctuation, misspellings, repeated titles, etc. The performance is rather stodgy, with the entire production staged on a series of severely tilted platforms (perhaps symbolism of the unstable world in which the story is supposed to have taken place). Singing was good, but not spectacular. All-in-all not what I have come to expect from the Glyndebourne Festival.	2.0	0

med_178236	I enjoyed the story line and how the dashshund interacted with each person.

Superman looks oddly shriveled and old; I don't care for the animation style. The cartoon is just a meh. This may have been a project that should have either been done right, including most of the comic book story, over several episodes, or not at all."	2.0	0
med_178239	If you can get past the recasting of Paige, you probably still won't like it. This movie should have never been made. New Paige is flirting with another guy almost immediately into the film, even though she's supposedly madly in love and getting married in 3 weeks. She's upset when Edvard is busy in parliament, but HELLO SHE'S A MED STUDENT. Obviously that SHOULD be taking up her time. Absolutely terrible. I wish I could give it zero stars.	1.0	0
med_178240	Anyone who's seen the Extended Versions and then has gone back to watch the Theatrical Versions realizes that the story seems full of holes. The only reason this is being released is, as others have said, to squeeze every dollar out of the fans of this movie series that they can.

med_178278	I want to start off by saying that I don't blame the seller for the low rating. The movie came quickly and was shrink wrapped. That being said, the quality was horrible. Waste of money.

med_178285	I love Japanese movies. I'm not being a hater but seriously this movie leaves you frustrated. The first 50 minutes were great but after that it sucked. the story goes multiple directions never pays off emotionally and its not hard hitting in anyway other frustration of time invested without payoff. I had high hopes because of all the high reviews but honestly I just don't get it with this one. My street cred; my favorite Ghibli movies are Princess Mononoke and Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind.	1.0	0
med_178286	Picked it up at a big box store before there were any amazon reviews, bit of a mistake there. Animation very dated, looks like it pre-dates Appleseed and the Final Fantasy movies actually. Music track sounds like it was created on someone pc not done by a studio. The idea for the story and voice acting is only reason I give it two stars. You could compress it down to a 20 minute episode and it would still feel too long though.	2.0	0
med_178288	This was a fun action film. There is not much plot set up. I am guessing they assume you already know about the Judge Dredd story. There are some creative filming styles. I believe that it was filmed with the intent of watching it in 3D, because there are some scenes that seem unnecessarily long until you realize how awesome it would look in 3D. I would not recommend this for anyone who is sensitive towards violence.	4.0	1

med_178331	Bummer of a Western. Only worth 1 star but gave it two stars for the good scenery and cinematography. Good movie if you enjoy watching a psychopathic cowboy kill everyone he meets. Could have been developed as a black humor piece, but there's no humor in this one. Waste of good actors.	2.0	0

med_178335	Pure Lunacy!!! It's like a train wreck, hard to turn away. I didn't understand how Treadwell claimed to be protecting the bears when he was on Federal land where hunting is prohibited, but his passion and dedication is undeniable.	2.0	0
med_178336	I ordered this for my 10 year old grandaughter's Christmas stocking and she loved it. She had rented this movie many times,but lately the rental shop didn't have it anymore,so she was heartbroken. I looked in our stores here,but couldn't find it anywhere. Of course, I know I can always find things at Amazon. So, I was very pleased to get it in time for Christmas.	5.0	1

med_178340	Whoa, this was bad. Like, seriously bad. It's as if someone decided to throw together a few hundred clichs from the past 30 years and try to make it a cohesive movie. And the acting is so over-the-top it was laughable. Like they were trying to be bad. Maybe that was the point and I just missed it? I hope so.	1.0	0

med_178346	This movie doesn't even get 1 star, it was terrible. The picture quality was poor, the acting was poor, and there was almost no character development. The film editing was the worst as was the story line, it went no where, there was no action, no climax ,no resolution and no ending. Don't waste your time or money!	1.0	0

med_178349	Movie was great. I really enjoyed it. British zombies and an unlikely here. But the thing is, Amazon forces you to buy the movie if you want to watch it. I HATE that. It's on cable and tv, watch it there until they decided to rent it cheap.	4.0	1
med_178350	This is truly a terrible film. The filmmakers obviously wanted to mate a Sergio Leone film with the Trinity series, but instead they came up with this mess. The leading man looks like a dusty Bee Gee and the comical sidekick does nothing but stereotype Mexicans. I have seen better use of the Spanish language on the drive-thru menu at Taco John's. If you do have three bullets, use them on your VCR to put it out of its misery after watching this.	1.0	0
med_178351	I bought this movie because I liked how to lose a guy in ten days. There is no chemistry between them, just Matt showing off his body. This is in my top ten worst films. Long, boring, & painful to get through. The only good thing is the blu ray quality!	1.0	0

med_178363	This movie is the absolute cream of the crap, vile rubbish for the true connoisseur. Kunfoo, Anime, chicks fighting with swords, blood spewing and splattering all over the place... It is better than being 13 again hanging out in your tree fort with a stack of new comic books and a six pack of beer you swiped from the old man. It is like Gwar, Shakespeare, comic books, beer, kungfoo and wrestling all wrapped together... topped with whipped cream AND sprinkles.	5.0	1

med_178377	Britt Robertson is lovely, lovely eye candy and it is worth watching just for her but the movie is mediocre at best.

med_178390	It's always a great movie. It's a great first Disney movie to watch for a 3 year old because it doesn't really have 'bad guys' or scary witches. It's pleasant and happy with adorable mice and lots of magic. The Bibbity Bobbity Boo scene is THE BEST!	5.0	1
med_178392	This movie was just awful. The plot was bad, the acting was even worse and it was really slow. The movie was just plain bad. So why did i give it one star? because i was interested the first ten minutes. I watched 45 minutes of it and then turned it off. My money and time was wasted on this movie. Don't watch it.	1.0	0

med_178402	This is one show that made a bet that its viewers had the attention span to follow a story line over several seasons, and boy did it pay off. We all have our favorite episodes in our family but we all think this is a five star show because it tells a great story without treating us like we are unable to keep up. Well Done!!	5.0	1
med_178403	Surprisingly good movie. Could be comedy, could be serious, a little of both. My husband even enjoyed the story line and sat through the whole movie. I would recommend this to any one that likes to watch a movie that you can see happening in real life.	4.0	1
med_178405	I bought this movie for my son. We just sat down to watch it and didn't even get 10 minutes into the movie before it stated skipping so bad that the rest of the movie wouldn't even play. Definitely not worth the money. Very disappointed!	1.0	0

With this DVD, however, the instructor did not give great cues and changed things up too fast. I couldn't follow the routine. I got very frustrated because I wasn't even breaking a sweat.

med_178435	Tough one to find and it really is a shocking and interesting story. Watch this one with your friends and fam and watch them squirm...

med_178437	We didn't watch the entire movie because we found it to be very un-engaging but we watched about 3/4 of it.

med_178484	A tad predictable--but despite that, it made me cry three different times, and applaud my TV screen twice. The 7-year-old girl, Maggie Elizabeth Jones, deserved at least an Oscar nomination....and Matt Damon and Scarlett Johansson weren't too shabby either.	5.0	1

med_178493	I love Lost Horizon. But the movie is a musical. The vocal parts were ok but all the songs were so muted it made the movie miserable to watch.

med_178499	With a 16 year old son, 14 year old son, and 10 year old daughter, it can be challenging to make a pick for family movie night. It is a trick to find a film that the boys won't roll their eyes at, but at the same time won't be too adult for the girl. Mr. Hobbs fit the bill. All three got a kick out of it and have turned into Jimmy Stewart fans.	5.0	1

It's a story about two teenagers in different parts of Japan and the unlikely and amusing connection they share. Aside from the story itself, another part of what makes me love this movie so much is its soundtrack. I purchased this movie for my friend who watches a lot of anime and they loved it as well. I highly recommend!	5.0	1

med_178525	Honestly, I only watched this for the Eddie Redmayne scenes. Hey, the men are only watching it for the Jessica Biel scenes, so why not? The writing was clich-ridden, but both these actors transcended characters that could easily have been two-dimensional. Unfortunately, the rest of the movie really dragged for me, and some of the scenes were so gooey I found myself scraping them off my shoe. Not great, but enjoyable for any Eddie Redmayne completist.	2.0	0

med_178660	If this is the Ori plot ender, wow, they should have just stuck it in a regular TV episode, minus the helicopter shots and pointless filler. It was the most dissatisfying SG1 product to date in terms of plot and dialogue. I can't bear to watch it a second time. Buy Continuum, a first rate loving tribute to fans who are fully familiar with the series.	1.0	0

med_178667	Eagle Eye is an interesting blend of The Matrix, Wanted, and The Fugitive. Action scenes are amazing, the acting is just about perfect, but unfortunately the plot is outlandish and just not believable. This takes away from the immersion quite a bit. Eagle Eye is worth watching, especially for it's long but incredibly entertaining action sequences. Just don't expect a very believable plot.	4.0	1
med_178668	Every once in a while I believe that an actor takes on a poor script because they (like all of us) have debts. This seemed to be that kind of a movie. Make a crappy movie, collect your check, pay your mortgage.	1.0	0

med_178670	I read the book and I think the videos are good. I think Diamond is a left-winger. Guns, Germs and Steel is pretty much non-stop European bashing. Somewhat over simplified, what about all the the barbarians that beat up on the Europeans? Does not give much credit to the good Europeans may have done in their expansion.	4.0	1

med_178676	Entire movie is about Jeremy Renner trying to get pills. Little to no plot or substance. Chase scene at the end of the movie seems to last for about 40 minutes. One of the worst big budget movies that I have ever seen. Save your $5 and rent something else.	2.0	0

med_178681	Eddie and Richard are two losers who were bullied as children. Adulthood is not much different. They opt to get guns and fight back and suddenly when things go awry they find themselves way over their heads leaving the audience with nothing to root for but a quick end to the film.

Then if you like it buy, however with this ""movie"" I would pay serious money to have it removed from Amazon's inventory."	1.0	0

med_178689	I thought that for the most part the final season was really great, and closed up the series pretty well. The second to the last episode was bleh, and the last episode was mediocre, except for the last 10 minutes which were perfect for the series closer. Still except for these last two items, season 8 is definitely worth watching.	4.0	1

med_178698	A well made film, just not very interesting. The premise never really reaches its full potential despite the great effects and succeeds in being one of the blandest 80s genre films about malevolent household appliances. Blu Ray Review (1 disc) No features.	2.0	0

med_178703	I am a HUGE fan of Mr. Tyler Perry, but this play was not that great. It seemed like it was thrown together. Sometimes they would forget their lines and just babble, it was weird. The background music was too low and the mics were too loud, so when they were singing it sounded a bit off key. The woman who played Diana could not sing at all and it was very annoying to listen too. The funniest parts were with Poppy.	2.0	0
med_178704	I really enjoyed this scary movie. It was very suspenseful and creepy. The special effects were great and it was worth the money. I miss really good horror flicks.

med_178742	Before I purchased this DVD collection I was kind of expecting something like the Twighlight Zone, or Tales of the Darkside, but it was nothing like these two. I enjoy science fiction, but I need a little mystery, melodrama, something inspiring that keeps my attention. The Outer Limits seriously lacks those things. The only episode that is definetely worthwhile is Conversion, because it has a nice lesson, about everything being interconnected. Overall, I do not recommend, 1 star.	1.0	0

Patented seeds are like any other patent. A contract is a contract. The authors are more than welcome to not to buy from corporate related food products and consume the organically grown livestock and produce that has the same potential for e-coli bacterial contamination as anything else or worse (e.g., manure fertilizer).	1.0	0

It's like an American ""The Thick of It"" without a guy having to whip his dick out every thirty seconds, which would be hilariously hot if I were attracted to men and that was a literal statement. Instead, we get Julia, who is a total PILF. Like, way hotter than Sarah Palin. Who Julia's character is supposedly based upon."	4.0	1

med_179005	First and foremost, this has Alice Cooper...and he sings...Alice Cooper y'all. That covers a multitude of sins. And this movie has them, terrible dialogue and stereotypical character ensemble included. However, the cast does a good job with what they have, the plot is cool, and there's kind of a sexy vibe throughout and again it has Alice Cooper. All in all, this one deserves to be the cult classic that it is.	4.0	1

med_179065	This one was pretty good for a little bit. Until the very end was when I didn't like it. The reason I didn't like it was because the killer was some kind of demon or something.

med_179096	That foreign woman in the yellow jacket was a piece of work.

med_179127	Probably my own fault but I only discovered upon playing this DVD that it was only a 60-minute recording. A waste of the DVD format?

med_179192	it still was a good movie. Several parts of the book and characters were left out but it pretty well followed the general outline of the book. The movie lasted for over 3 hours and would have been about 9 hours if all was included. The characters that were included were well portrayed. The villain, Played by Tim Curry, was indeed sinister.	4.0	1

I'm sorry but the bad guys got away with much too much, Tony and Tia weren't up for much, and all I wanted to do was hand my plate back and say 'this is for a restricted diet, I can have salt.'

med_179197	Nice movie. Could be better. Didn't live up to its hype.	4.0	1
med_179198	This was an interesting concept, but I found it too complicated to follow. I couldn't really figure why a pupeteer actually wanted to be John Malkovitch. I also did not find any of the charactrs particularly sypmatheic. I couldn't figure out most of the plot, maybe I didn't watch it longenough to fugure where it was going. It's probably a very good movie if you like complicated plots. I didn't really like or understand it, so I turned it off.	1.0	0

med_179287	Take the title literally - the characters keep breaking into song - long songs. It's a novel way to handle a plot but I didn't care for it, though I see it's value. Some of the songs are actually quite beautiful in and of themselves but I would rather have seen this film without the music. The characters were well developed and I liked most of them but this missed by a mile for me.	2.0	0
med_179288	I enjoy this movie, but the first was far better. The DVD released by Image is subpar in terms of quality. It contains a trailer and scene selection and that's it.

Still, it's better than a VHS copy, but just barely.	4.0	1

med_179356	"I truly enjoy most British productions of this type, however, after giving these a try and enduring, yes ""enduring"" 3 or 4 of these episodes, we just couldn't take it any more. Although the plot of the story is sometimes a bit entertaining, however, the overall after taste we had after watching each episode was sour and depressing."	2.0	0

med_179370	This Season I think started the downhill fall for the Comedy Series King of Queens. This season had some of the dumbest and most boring episodes ever. Doug and Carrie argue WAYYYYY to much now and its hurtful arguing and not funny, stuppid arguing. Deacon rarely shows up and I miss that! :(. So what I basically trying to say is that this Season is not very good. Thats just my opinion	2.0	0

med_179379	Renee Fleming is a very moving Violeta. Rolando Villazon is the best Alfredo I heard, whether on CD or DVD, even better than with Anna Nertebko at the Salzburg Festival 2005.

med_179453	I guess you have to 1. know and 2. care who these actors are. they are (to me) the 3rd string of flash-in-the pan but yet they made the movie - the premise is based on being familiar with the People Mag version of these people - appreciating that James Franco is a quirky guy is tantamount to getting any of the jokes. since i don't give a crap about any of them on screen or off, I was a little underwhelmed by the exercise.	2.0	0

med_179455	The dialog was hard to follow. To understand it, you had to either turn on closed captioning so you could read it and then, really think about what the characters were saying, or trying to say.

med_179527	I'm pissed that I spent so much money on a DVD I can't even watch. I didn't realize that I was buying this movie from Europe and it wouldn't play in my BluRay player in the United States. Be forewarned.... if you buy a movie from a different continent it won't be compatible.	1.0	0
med_179528	I LOVED rainbow Brite as a child and wanted to share the cartoon with my young daughter. Mistake. This movie was pretty terrible. Poor animation. Very few of the other original characters were in the movie or were only shown for brief periods. Not that great, I'll still show her the cartoons, but we will skip the movie in the future.	2.0	0

med_179530	Ok. Lets me start--fat, ugly, old chicks are playing young, skinny, pretty. They walking, they jumping and show some skin but never private parts. Ok. Its not really a movie as nothing moves, not even hint to a plot. Should I continue? Avoid.	1.0	0

med_179539	This DVD is excellent for days when you are lacking the time to get in a good workout. Denise is really easy to follow and has a pleasant tone. Her moves vary throughout each routine, which is excellent. This workout is not for anyone who is really trying to make big changes because each workout is only 12 minutes long. Overall I like to do this workout when I am lacking time or not as energetic for a longer workout.	4.0	1

med_179557	Agree with what everyone else was posting on IMDB about the alien story. The first story and the third story were great. And the overarching story about the babysitter and kids that find the vhs tape was also quite enjoyable. Woulda been 5 stars if not for that alien story. The alien story wasn't horrible but it just didn't fit in very well. Art the (demonic? psychotic for sure) Clown was creepy as hell. Great raw horror.	4.0	1

med_179578	Did not enjoy this movie at all. Where the other 2 were honest portrayals of 2 peoples lives, this one seems totally staged. The dialog was predictable and so much of it was unnecessary. In my mind, is not what happened to this couple after who met on the train so many years ago.	1.0	0

med_179583	It's interesting to see Patrick Stewart play a bad guy, and he does it well. But I feel like this story could have been a taut psychological thriller without resorting to so much gore. I could even understand that the writer felt that you need to incorporate ultra violence when telling a story about white supremacists. But it could still have been so violent without all the gore. For me it detracted from the storytelling.	2.0	0
med_179584	"Anyone can enjoy this movie. Great story based on a ""real"" person. All of the actors are good but the stars are the lady played by Sandra Bullock, the football player (played by?) and the son. I never tire of watching this movie."	5.0	1
med_179585	Great scenery. That's it. Everything else was just awful. Derivative, disjointed, nonsensical plot, horrible writing, jolting visual transitions, overacting in every scene, and the worst sound effects processing I've ever heard. Every single scene that has added sound effects echoes, badly. Every single one. Peter O'Toole couldn't save this. His acting was very good as usual, but he was given a horrible part in a horrible movie.	1.0	0

med_179601	It was breathtaking in its cinematography and many of its characters were easy to identify with. However, the female lead was poorly developed so that instead of garnering understanding, sympathy or empathy, she simply appeared pathetic. Was she previously ill mentalIy or did she have some other reason for her extreme behavior under circumstances over which she could and should have exerted some control? It was slow, too, and I have a high tolerance for slower pics when they are more substantive. JB	2.0	0

About a half hour in, I already knew how the movie was going to end, and I already could tell you the plot on how everything panned out. I would not waste my time with this movie, or money.

I would think that the reason for that would be simply because they were just that; discovered much later! As well might a possible oral tradition have been in play? Thank you !"	1.0	0

med_179661	Sorry, I can't be impartial here. I like auto racing; I like Formula One racing; I like historic racing films; I like Cinerama; and James Garner is one of my favorite actors.

Skip the interminable musical intro.	5.0	1
med_179662	Blade Runner is a good movie. It's interesting and different. The set design is really good. Especially near the end of the movie. The actual director's cut is a little too slow at times. Without the commentary, parts of the movie are a little boring as people do stuff you don't care about. With the commentary by Harrison Ford, you don't really pay attention to that stuff. It's a good movie, but wait for a better edition.	4.0	1

med_179685	Very well made. Actors were excellent. Story line was different, interested. You really get into the issues with Panem and wonder how the world got that way. Katniss is a reluctant hero. I can watch over and over.	5.0	1
med_179686	Very intriguing concept and typically love JJ, but this show is just too boring for us. Reminded us of Flash Forward, but not near as interesting as that show was, and it was canceled after just one season, but if we hear it gets good later, might give it a second chance.	2.0	0

med_179693	Picture quality is the worst of any DVD I have ever bought, and there is a constant buzzing, or ringing sound, kinda like film turning on reel, but loudly.

med_179697	I really liked this movie. Of course I am 73 years of age, and in my second childhood perhaps. I also like fantasy like this. I did not know what to make of the beginning with tiny screen and all black and white. I kept trying to make the screen bigger, silly me, Then I realized it would all change and it did once he landed in OZ where the screen got larger and color came then.	5.0	1
med_179698	I think this series is stale. The only good thing I can say about Grey's Anatomy is that it's not about the trenches of war, and murder in all of its variations including a dreary lexicon of one word.	2.0	0
med_179701	I love Tim Allen, so I was really disappointed in the quality of this film. The script was very poorly written, and the cast seemed to just do the best they could with what they had. Would never watch it again, or recommend it.	1.0	0
med_179702	"This documentary had some interesting interviews and gives a inside look at many different facets of Christianity in America but it was very jumbled and hard to follow overall and really seemed to focus on the extreme ends of the spectrum while leaving out more mainline Christianity all together. It does very little to show much of the good that the Christian ""church"" is doing in America and abruptly ends with a depressing and very judgemental conclusion. I would not waste your time with this!"	2.0	0
med_179703	Any slower it would have been a rewind, sad plot and a failure to communicate..	2.0	0
med_179704	NOT multi-format, as advertised. It was bad enough that this didn't arrive by Christmas, as originally stated, but I received a blu-ray ONLY copy. No digital or dvd copies included. That makes this worthless for the intended gift recipient as they don't have a blu-ray player. As an unimportant detail, but final bow to wrap this failure, it comes in a standard, small blu-ray case. It does not come in a nice cardboard set as displayed either. It won't even be a pretty paperweight.	1.0	0

med_179711	Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (Jamie Lannister in Game of Thrones), the antagonist in this movie is what sparked my interest to want to watch this Norwegian action thriller film.

I highly recommend watching this foreign film!	4.0	1
med_179712	this movie was great until the creature was revealed in the end. as another customer stated, it is so CGI and looks like something from scify channel. I would have probably given it 3.5-4 stars if the creature had not been so utterly ridiculous looking.	2.0	0

med_179729	Not bad.....that's how I would begin in this tale of murderous unsuspected fishnet plot. The movie plays as a Spanish telenovela soap, with a opening of a woman tumbling and running for dear life while a brooding mysterious male Pursues her. The following scenes are the mediocre tale of revenge, lust, greed, power and betrayal. If your into telenovelas buy it, if not don't.	4.0	1

med_179737	Jackie Chans latest offering in a kind of Indiana Jones in a Tuxedo sort of movie.

med_179747	Everything about this movie was choppy. I felt like I was watching a made at home 2 hour youtube movie. I walked out of it once.

I think those of us who have experienced the rich dialogue, wonderful descriptions and the complete story will probably agree that the film falls short of a decent portrayal of the book.

med_179771	While this video seems to collect criticism it would seem to me to be misplaced. This movie is a great vehicle for Paul Mc Cartney to play a few tunes and have some fun, not a serious attempt to create an epic. There is a little morality tale about an ex-convict woven into the plot but it still stays fairly lighthearted. The secret of enjoying this movie is to not take it too seriously.	4.0	1

Very good workout that feels like you could do it at two months or nine months along. It has variations for beginners, intermediate and advance. The advanced level is very challenging. The production quality is not the best, (that's why I didn't rate as 5 stars) but the content is top notch. Highly recommended.	4.0	1

med_179849	The string skipping technique that Danny Gill teaches are challenging enough to complement or supplement any existing skills. As advertised, there is an appropriate exercise for all levels. Also, Danny Gill goes over the rhythmic background, the chord progression and fingering -some of them not basic either! But, what I like is that the melodic exercises taught in this DVD are not just for building string skipping technique. These exercises are also functional so any performer may build their own nifty creation around them.	5.0	1

med_179873	The first 15 minutes of this movie is the funniest thing about this movie. There are some other funny parts,but this movie is weak. The character Goldmember ruined the movie. This movie is dissapointing. The best Austin Powers movie is,and forever will be,Part 2. Peace Out	2.0	0
med_179874	This workout is freaking amazing. I've done the whole dvd workout deal for a while now and this one is by far my favorite.

I highly reccomend this workout to anyone considering it.	5.0	1
med_179875	Ink is a great movie! Its complex enough to still be interesting after watching it over and over again, and yet simple enough that you can get the story line in the first sitting.

med_179879	I choose this rating because I recently opened my packed I bought a while back & I can't enjoy watching it in piece because the DVDs came out defective for some parts it completely freezes for a while or it then freezes & skips the scene. The DVDs came out all scratched up & I don't understand why if in between the DVDs they had a little sponge.	1.0	0
med_179880	While the acting wasn't quite up to Academy Awards level, the story moved quickly and there was sufficient action to keep up one's interest.	4.0	1
med_179881	Eh. Two stars for effort. Acting is poor, but the script doesn't really allow for it either. Sort of comedy, perhaps funny for Lovecraft aficionados. I feel a bit bad giving this only two stars. The movie had its charm, but in the end the lack of acting made it boring.	2.0	0
med_179882	I am very disappointed in this DVD. I did not see anything in the advertisement that said it was salt water reel fishing only.

med_179891	Having just been to the museum in Philadelphia earlier this year, this film was particularly interesting to me.

med_179901	Amazing movie that has several layers of complexity, combined with excellent character arcs and great action. One of my new fave MCU movies, up there with Guardians of The Galaxy, Captain America: Winter Soldier, and Ant Man. Marvel has done it again.	5.0	1
med_179902	Good movie with interesting story line. I enjoyed it on a late Saturday afternoon with the house to myself. It keeps you entertained if you like period stuff. This one was around the late 1800's, characters were good and seemed pretty true to that time period.	4.0	1
med_179903	A gory and gruesome horror show finish to a story that at times seems to drag; but the true to life feel of this Western and the excellent character portrayals and very well crafted dialog among the main characters make this a likable sleeper.	4.0	1
med_179904	I really didn't like this storyline at all. The graphics were great but I really didn't find it amusing nor engaging. I will not bother watching two.	1.0	0
med_179905	Well, this is not what you would think it would be, and probably not a real life situation in the way it ended. Really can't understand what was in the mind of the person creating the storyline. It did have some lessons learned and the actors had to be very tough people to keep the moral aspect in check. Lots of subtitles, so if you like to read, then give this movie a shot. I, frankly, wouldn't waste my time watching it again.	2.0	0
med_179906	Haven't seen it forever. It is as good as I remember. Best ratpack movie. It just got added to my Christmas movie collection	5.0	1
med_179907	How on earth anyone could take an Elmore Leonard book and turn it into one of the most excruciatingly boring movies ever made remains beyond me. Tarantino had no sense of pacing whatsoever on this disastrous excursion. The movie moves at the speed of mammal evolution. Quentin failed at adapting the book. He sucked all the life from the novel then filmed the corpse. Avoid it at all costs, because it's 2 and a half hours of your life you'll never get back.	1.0	0

med_179942	Let me be clear. the one star is for price. The show is ok, nowhere near as good as The Walking Dead, but who would shell out 30-40 dollars for a season with ONLY 6 episodes! Won't buy until it is around $15.	1.0	0
med_179943	I have no idea if I like the movie itself or not, but the video transfer is not watchable. It's like watching UHF TV in 1974. I'm sure there has to be a better version of this, but this is garbage.	1.0	0

med_179976	This movie was packed full of explosions and fight scenes that were out of place. The story line characterized the Secret Service and Military as incompetent blundering fools.

med_180004	This could have been written better! Most of the classics like Prince Valiant, Robin Hood, and Ivanhoe are all wonderful in their original films from the 50's and 6's, but THIS is atrocious! You don't do a REmake of a film unless you're going to significantly IMPROVE on the original in some way; a remake of this film could ONLY be an improvement!	2.0	0
med_180007	I don't want to give away the movie but I do not recommend this for young or sensitive children. There are genuinely sad moments that some reviewers said made their children cry. There is no real explanation for the existence of the Neverbeast nor why the fairies forgot about him in the first place. The scout fairies do not fit in with the whole concept of Neverland. For me, it was a bit clumsy and incoherent. But I am an adult and see things differently.	2.0	0

med_180031	This is a very bad film... It is nicely shot, and the set location is good, but the plot (college kid outsmarts global super-powerful secret society) is just terrible. It's one of those films where you actually hope there isn't a happy ending (we can wish, can't we?!)	1.0	0

med_180056	The most irritating thing to me besides an inane adaptation of a very good book was the absolute lack of attention to detail. I did enjoy watching the migration of the airborne patches to various headgear locations and the junior officers strutting around in heavy bomber crew sheepskins. A disservice to memory of the 101st, the 506 regiment and Easy company in particular.	2.0	0
med_180057	...that's the best way to describe this series. This is one of those, if it hadn't been associated with the He-man universe, the concept could have stood alone as its own series. I will admit, the animation is good and the writing is ok, but the bottom line that will always hurt this series is that it's not He-man and should never have carried the title.	2.0	0
med_180058	"I went to this movie thinking it would be similar to the Bourne movies but was sadly disappointed. It is a political message movie plain and simple, there really is nothing to it, no action, no drama, nothing... poor acting and that ""I'm in the action"" crap with the camera moving and shaking is horrible."	1.0	0
med_180059	Ok, reviews were great, but did these people really view this movie. Honestly, the whole movie could have been summarized in about a 20 minute clip. Sorry for the spoiler, ballerina fights with her dark side that only she sees for the fight of perfection and in the end she kills herself to complete the perfect ending to being the principle. The only good scene is the girl on girl one. Even after skipping a few chapters the story line was still clear. Such a waste of money.	1.0	0

med_180069	Jim and Zoey make a great team in this movie - while Jim is his usualy goofy slap-stick self through many parts Zoey creates a nice balance and brings some real-life to the story.

med_180086	"Although this movie is not encoded with Dolby 5.1, the casts' acting and the story are good enough to keep you stayed with the movie. It will not disappoint those Alec Baldwin's fans as he did a very good job by acting as a talent lawyer ( as he did in "" Ghosts of Mississippi "" ) I myself am Alec's fan and I keep up the collection with all his movies. His potential can make a lot of aspects in action, adventure, sci-fiction movies besides dramas."	4.0	1

med_180096	The direction and acting was terrible. I expected more from Ernest Borgnine but he should have stopped with McHale and Dom of the Airwolf era. It's hard to explain why this was so bad of a movie but on a few occasions I actually considered just deleting it without further viewing.	1.0	0

med_180121	I gave this movie 2 stars because it's not dreadful. It suffers from every possible way a film can from budget restraints to dialogue, but the cast is surprisingly good and the story isn't terrible but as I stated earlier the budget hurts. The creature CGI was poor but that's what happens when you don't have enough money. If you need a creature feature quick fix, you could do worse.	2.0	0

I found that there were way too many breaks in between sets and found it too easy, even with the increase of weights. It didn't even raise my heart rate that much. If you are just starting out, this workout would be great, for those who are more intermediate or advanced, I would save your money!!!	1.0	0
med_180185	Kind of what I expected unfortunately. Very slow with nothing that makes it stand out. Nothing about this made me want to learn more about any of the characters. They are all forgettable. The pace was so slow I had no problems simply walking away to go to the kitchen or do something else and not feel like I was going to miss anything. The show feels almost monochromatic. This seems to be a recurring theme with Amazon series. Even the shows I like feel slow and somewhat uncompelling.	2.0	0

med_180211	truly an awful movie. aside from the numerous irrelevant and uninteresting scenes scattered throughout this movie it is both socially and' culturally inaccurate. it displays both the western and muslim world as one-dimensional with every reference based completely off over-played stereotypes. it insults islam and muslim women everywhere' by degrading the hijab and by making a mockery of verses from the Qur'an. additionally the actors are hideous looking and their acting is similar.	1.0	0

med_180228	These performances from around 1990 are interesting from an artistic point of view, particularly the Rite of Spring. However these are taken from television broadcasts and the video and audio quality are very poor. Probably they duplicate the experience of watching the performance on a Soviet-made television. Sound is also quite poor.	2.0	0
med_180229	This is one that I saw while I was in the service. Shot in Boston, my home town once apron a time, I enjoyed it and have wanted it to be a part of my library for quite some time now.

med_180235	After years of hearing about this film, I finally obtained a copy of it and found it to be every bit as wild and controversial as I'd always heard. Interesting that there were never any other films of this type, that being a production that included top rated actors & actresses, high dollar production values and an intriguing story line too boot. Aside from the low quality of the cinematograpy, I was pleased with this purchase. It definitely was a memorable film to watch.	4.0	1
med_180236	"There seems to be lot of these movies being produced now in wake of ""The Living Dead."" There is no background or story given and the viewer just has to accept the situation as it is. The film is about family holed up in a farmhouse while this going on simply trying to survive. The protagoninst, Robert Mulkin (Chris Mulkey) is a good actor, but has a mediocre performance here and simply does the best that he can given the situation."	2.0	0
med_180237	This movie is fabulous entertainment, but if anacronisms and historical idiosyncracies bug you terribly, I'd skip it. If you're looking for a documentary, go to PBS, if you want a delightful interpretation--look here.	4.0	1

med_180346	The acting was decent, hence the two stars. And production values decent as well. Storyline had some promise... the electronic aspect. But it was very contrived. And IMO, other than the main character, every character was bitchy, and irrational. It did seem 80s like... but at least the successful, 80s campy movies were funny. This wasn't funny.

med_180350	i would understand why a number of people would find this DVD dull, its not extremely entertaining and on occasion in the format of an average documentary. however after following the cky crew my whole life i did still enjoy the simple antics of Dunn, Vito, and Dico. i would recommend the original CKY videos to start off with to those whom are not current followers of the crew, and build up to have enough familiarity to enjoy this just for the sheer following. i did enjoy this video.	4.0	1

med_180374	Too much violence. The hi tech sci-fi world versus still slavery of districts are two contrast combinations Just a replica of old roman time movies with gladiator etl being redone with science fiction Fundamentally the Idea of killing for survival in PG13 does not sound appropraite... If it is something like fighting and killing aliens or other fictional characters to protect humans some what goes ok, but idea of humans killing humans makes it uncomfortable to watch --Deepak	2.0	0

med_180380	Pretty much not what it seems to be. Mainly low tech bits from television of what appears to be the 60s. Willie is in 2 or 3 tracks. The rest are Dolly and a few others. Can't give more information as we did not listen to the entire DVD. Off to the Library.	1.0	0

I will watch it again."	4.0	1
med_180399	It's pretty good and definitely worth viewing. The story is a bit lacking but the premise is genius. Morgan Freeman is wonderful as always and it was fun seeing ScarJo in a different role. I enjoyed the movie and would reccomend it for the casual sci-fi fan out there.	4.0	1
med_180400	I realize that a lot of people think this show is a little hard to grasp, but I found it refreshing. It is a little dated, but shows a lot about the 80's and is always filmed in beautiful locations. Pretty funny and usually a good plot without being too serious.	4.0	1

med_180435	Disappointed. The Johnny Appleseed is an ancient version, with antiquated language that gets my 4th graders riled up like: queer (odd) and gay (happy. The John Henrey Legend was not that well done or too interesting, though my students could tolerate that one better, haven't seen the 3rd one. I did like some of the narration for setting up the genre. I wish they were called or at least mentioned that these are also Tall Tales which is common in education. Wouldn't buy again.	2.0	0

med_180445	It's rare to find a film that feels as real as this one. The story is as predictable as life is. Cliches, by definition, lack imagination and heart, and this film has both in spades.

med_180447	The picture and sound quality are excellent, but the widescreen version is the worst fit for a 16:9 television screen I've come across. It doesn't go all the way to the edge without stretching it and no matter how I fiddle with the aspect ratio on the television, it just doesn't work right. No other widescreen film on dvd have I had this sort of problem with, it's just a bit TOO letterboxed.	2.0	0

When I moved to this country in the mid 1950's, she was already off the air and I felt I had missed something that all my little peers were familiar with.

med_180503	This is definitely the worst movie I've ever seen. Absolutely horrible. It's boring, far fetched,shallow, undeveloped, and just plain bad. I can't believe all the 5 star ratings!

med_180531	This movie is the worst of it's type to date. More a series of classic rock music videos strung together than anything else, It never pulls you into the world it is trying to create. Donnie Brasco, Goodfellas, even Godfather III. Make this a film I think Johnny Depp should probably try and buy all copies and burn. Get the soundtrack instead. Long and boring non-involving, bad acting and bad wigs make this truly unwatchable.	1.0	0
med_180532	I am a Health and Physical Education teacher at an elementary school. During the state testing week I do yoga with my Prek - [...] I wasn't impressed when I previewed the video. I decided to show it to my students anyway. Of the three videos I showed them this was their favorite because it kept them moving. I felt that the quality of the video was not as good as Marsha Wenig's Yoga Kids Videos. But, like I said the students liked this one the most.	5.0	1

med_180616	Mary's spiral from top med student to back room body mod surgeon is disturbing and bizarre. Darkly satiric with fast, pointed delivery, the film is populated with characters that are a dichotomy of outward appearances and internal motivations.

Horrifyingly watchable.	4.0	1

This film was put together not too long after the silent era, and the special effects, while viewed as ""outdated"" by today's standards, were pretty effective for 1938.

med_180646	The movie cover is misleading because it isn't a cartoon, its an educational documentary with a fictional plot geared towards children. When it started went to turn it off because I automatically assumed my 5 year old would dislike it but he asked to continue watching it and ended up loving the movie. He is still talking about everything he learned and the exciting plot ( in his perspective). I would recommend it to elementary science clubs and any child with an interest in marine biology/nature.	4.0	1
med_180647	I wanted this to be a great movie but it definitely fell short. Rather than weaving an engrossing story I thought this was more of a series of scenes strung together for historical accuracy.

med_180661	This movie started out very interesting, a little bloody, but interesting nonetheless. However, as it went on it continued to get more and more ridiculous between heads exploding like fireworks and enough of the F-word to keep up with Gran Torino.

med_180688	Kind of slow sometimes but overall a pretty good movie.	4.0	1
med_180689	I waited years for this, so I knew what to expect. It's a bit repetitive, but if you like the Hudsons, go for it! If you don't, then this won't convert you.	4.0	1
med_180690	Quality of tape so bad I couldn't watch it.	2.0	0
med_180691	Exemplary, witty, extremely engaging. My only regret is that season 4 is not free for prime members. I've seen many of the season4 episodes, including the season finale, I just wanted to see how the situation from season 3 resolves at the very beginning of season 4. I don't really feel like paying for it though.	5.0	1
med_180693	"It is unfortunate that Kate Sackhoff was part of this. She is better than this movie. Still it had potential, but the dialogue was largely too adolescent, as was the ""love story"". The IT probably had the best dialogue in the script. There could have been a great love scene, character developement for all, in fact, if you put an actor on the cover, shouldn't they be the main character? Oh well! It's a shoot em up with a tease.... not nice."	2.0	0
med_180694	This movie is based on a computer game. the story is nice and Angelina Jolie did a great job. quite exciting. it is worth talking a look.	4.0	1
med_180695	I saw this during its theatrical run. Great casting. It was especially cool to see Jason Bateman, but it didn't deliver. I would recommend this if you like American Pie, you know, gross out humor with a heart, otherwise steer clear of this one. At the screening I went to everybody seemed to enjoy it, so I could be wrong. One more thing, Parker Posey was seriously underused here, and Diaz & Applegate had great chemistry. Couldn't save this movie though.	2.0	0

med_180700	This movie is everything you'd think it would be for this genre and Disney. It tells the story, while smoothing over the rough edges (or leaving them out entirely). Worth watching once to at least know the story. Fascinating that the common thread in all these ocean/sea based stories is just how much poor seamanship plays a role in setting the stage for great feats of seamanship.	4.0	1

med_180702	No one gives the Russians the credit they deserve for stopping Hitler. Sure, Hitler and Stalin were desperate dictators at heart and murderous killers at heart, but one had to win. Stalingrad is arguably the greatest battle of WWII. Without the Russians we'd all be in trouble. Good movie.	5.0	1
med_180703	Lots of fun. Put me back to when my imagination was so innocent. Perfectly family oriented. Not violent really. Beautiful horse, wonderful story line. Those poor seven children... eternally turned into horses until one precious necklace was returned to the Black Knight. Ha! Great story.	5.0	1
med_180705	Excellent movie, well worth the watching. A few curse words that could have been left out and then it would have been appropriate for young adults. The story is worth sharing with them.	5.0	1
med_180706	My favorite sitcom from my childhood. The 1966 movie was charming and funny. Great supporting actors in Terry Thomas and Richard Dawson. Nice to see this color movie in Blu-ray. The 1985 movie doesn't have quite the same charm, notably it really misses Butch Patrick, well we are used to multiple Marilyns. Fred Gwynne and Al Lewis retain their comedic talents. Wish they had Lily more prominent in the 1985 movie. Sid Caesar was excellent and funny as the villain.	5.0	1

med_180709	I thought I was suffering from senility - SO MANY SCENES ARE MISSING from the original. Who makes these stupid decisions? Character motivations seem to be arbitrary or totally missing. Not to mention the cooking scene where the title of the movie comes into play - LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE - it's gone. What a total bust!	2.0	0
med_180710	I really wanted to love it, but I didn't. The acting was poor. The cast looked like local theater rejects, with the exception of Dean Cain. I admit that he was the main reason I even watched it. I wonder how that wonderful man has fallen on such bad times that he has to take such dreck. Nevertheless, he does a good job and the movie is watchable....barely.	2.0	0

med_180713	Michael York and Tracy Lords (York - Lords...where's her Royal Highness?) stumble their way through what was a classic 50's film by Roger Corman. Lately Michael York in a movie means they couldn't sober up that other actor they really wanted. And Tracy Lords can't wash off her porno image and slap on a pretense of being able to act. It's just a waste of time. Unless you'd prefer not to watch infomercials. I'd rather watch the infomercials.	1.0	0
med_180714	what a waste of time...the cast was great, many actors I have enjoyed watching but yet for all their skills they couldn't save this one. Sure some funny lines and a few laughs but overall pick something else and save yourself the time.	2.0	0

med_180722	THIS IS A GREAT ONE MILE WORKOUT. I HAVE A LOT OF LESLIE SANSONE DVDs AND TAPES AND THIS ONE IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES. IT'S THE FASTEST MOVING ONE MILE WORKOUT YET. IT IS SIMILAR TO THE MUSCLE MILE ONE MILE TAPE BUT IT MOVES A LOT FASTER. THE MOVES ARE VERY SIMPLE TO FOLLOW AND THE USE OF WEIGHTS ARE BENEFICIAL. I AM VERY HAPPY WITH IT.	5.0	1
med_180723	It's a good horror/thriller. My only real issue is with the ending. It doesn't quite mesh with the explanation they gave for the mirrors. Still worth the watch and overall has pretty good acting and a solid story.	4.0	1
med_180724	In our family, The Christmas Carole is an annual read. We also watch multiple movie versions. This one was a first for me. I really enjoyed seeing such an old film - devoid of all the special effects of today. Vincent Price's narration was stellar. Research the man - he was much more than an actor.	4.0	1

med_180741	Almost as good as the first one, but not quite. Tom Hiddleston is SO GREAT as Loki again...some great plot twists in this film and fun to watch plot unfold into finale.

I would not be disappointed at all if no further episodes are presented, I can quickly forget this series."	2.0	0

That is with anything though. :) Enjoy	4.0	1
med_180746	This is a pretty good show it has its corney moments but has some interesting plot lines. It pretty much follows the storyline of Robin Hood with a few changes. The actors chosen for it are pretty good. Its not Emmy award winning but a nice show that the family can enjoy together. The violence is at a minimum and the stuff that is violet has been toned down and you never see any blood. Id say its ok for anyone over 8.	4.0	1

med_180757	premise of the movie seems to be that the wife lost a bet and has to spend the weekend in bondage. unfortunately hubby doesn't seem to be very interested in any actual bondage play .. just hand cuffing and BADDLY ball gagging the wife.

Not only a great sports-movie, a great hockey-movie but just a great movie-movie as well. The humor is vulgar in the best possible way. Great acting, memorable characters. Goon is a complete original with a smiling nod to Slapshot. One question: How did this not get a wide release in the theaters?	4.0	1

A typical early 60's condensation of the play for filming, with simple scenery, dramatic music, black & white filming, little choreographic complexity.

med_180845	I have to say I am a huge fan of this show until I watched season 4. What a monstrous disappointment. For the first 5 or 6 episodes, the acting is appalling. And John Goodman (whom I like) was just awful! I am glad I didn't purchase the disks and just got the video on demand for my xbox	1.0	0

med_180848	This is a very poorly constructed collection of Gay Men's Shorts. Two of the shorts; Popcorn & Coke and Uninhibited had the feels of interstitials that might have been shown among the trailers at a film festival. The DVD jacket promises a short called My Straight Boyfriend that's NOT actually included in the disk. Also the short listed as Truth or Consequences on the DVD cover is actually Truth or Dare on the disk. Its darkly lit and very grainy. Overall I'm NOT impressed with this collection.	2.0	0

med_180864	"One of THE worst ""horror"" movies I've ever had the displeasure of watching, & I've watched PLENTY of B-movies of this genre, many of which are far superior.

med_180867	"Highly recommended. The story is a bit on the strange side,but that is what makes if fun. The series is fast paced, funny and highly entertaining. I enjoyed Ayumu's dry sense of humor and the whole ""I can't die"" thing."	5.0	1
med_180868	Jennifer Lawrence and a couple other actors made some sketchy performances throughout the movie, but the overall portrayal of the story, spectacles and whatnot were pretty solid.

med_180878	I was a big fan of the 80s TV series. I was hoping to be more along the TV series. It was not. This is a good action movie, but if you are expecting it to be like the 80s, you will be disappointed. Denzel is good in the movie. But he never watched one episode in his research for the movie. If I did not know about the TV series, this would have been a great movie. But I can not unring that bell.	2.0	0
med_180879	Well, obviously advertising this film with and selling out to SUV's was a mistake. So what was the point of making it a 'seussical' when singer/songwriter Taylor Swift never sings? True, the original book did say 'No one can sing who has smog in his throat.' Yet we have a whole crowd song and Audrey (Swift) does not join in. Why? Is she trying to show that she can sing and act? If so, it would be nice if someone explained that.	2.0	0

med_180882	It was artfully done and great acting, but the story was just too depressing and at times agonizing. Clever premise but it was difficult to get through.

med_180890	Question: What's the worst movie you have seen? We all have seen at least one, and this POS is certainly one the worst I have seen. The main character, out of shape and unable to act, seemed better suited to play a street pimp than a hero who saved the President. I borrowed this movie, and it saved me the regret of spending my money on absolute garbage.	1.0	0
med_180891	This would have been an amazing movie IF...they hadn't made a mockery of God by making him a satanic like 10 year old. My 21 year old son and I seriously thought he was supposed to be Satan when he first appeared and started speaking! Did not work at all! There is never any positive vibe from this character at all. It seems like he's elusive and not sure if he's really trying to help Moses or not.	2.0	0
med_180892	I don't agree with most of the negative reviews, I thought that Broken Fences was a very moving movie.

med_180940	This anime was cheap and only has 12 episodes. The concept was pretty interesting but I think could have been better explored with more episodes. Along with it being very short it didn't have a concluding episode. The ending was unfinished and didn't really answer anything. Feels like it needs at least one more episode. For all this together I am giving this a two. I would not recommend it. It just ended up being very disappointing.	2.0	0

Planet's ""Diaries""' is wholly meritorious in its laborious achievements and impressive contrivances, providing us with exceptional experiences of our confounding, nurturing, and ever-changing Mother.

med_181011	In all honesty you can waste your time reading some of the long winded reviews of others and still come out with less than what I'm about to tell you. This movie sucks! I'm a big time movie fan with a collection of about 500 dvds so don't take my warning lightly. This movie is in my opinion one of the worst movies that I have seen in literally decades. It has no saving graces, it's just plain bad.	1.0	0

med_181017	"I have experienced some of the things that Miyazaki has put in ""Princess Mononoke"". For example, i've had to step into fights and then get rejected by both sides. We ourselves are demons in a certain view. We hurt others when they're in the way of our dreams or whatever. For example, if I wanted to rule the world and my friend opposed me, I would hurt him. Miyazaki is clearly showing this and that's why I give ""Princess Mononoke"" a 5-stars rating."	5.0	1

med_181021	Awfully slow moving today. When it came out, it may have been a Spielberg project, a technological piece, but it definity lacks the wonder of ET or the appeal of Star Wars. The teen kids will find it rather tame, the horror scenes, not even as weird as Harry Potter. Sherlock Holmes is best handled by the BBC. Holmes is sort of an early James Bond, almost a Union Jack superman without the need for female companionship. Hmmm?	2.0	0

med_181067	Matt Damon plays such an unappealing character in this movie, I just could not watch the second half. Also, the young and wealthy in this movie are typical of the wealthy pleasure seeking crowd. They use their wealth for self indulgence and quite frankly, they are tiresome characters. Amoral roles are not exactly inspiring especialy as that is all I am seeing right now in the current presidential election. Enough!	2.0	0
med_181068	Perhaps I expected too much of Christopher Nolan after the spectacular Dark Knight trilogy. Good performance from Cavill, but far too much reliance on special effects. Fishburne is wasted in a tiny part, and as much as I love Amy Adams, she's a lousy Lois Lane. Watch Superman 2 with Christopher Reeve instead. Oh - and by the way - if you tally up the cost of all the destruction of property in this film, the world's economy would never recover.	2.0	0

med_181164	This is a really fun movie, but unfortunately, it is barely watchable. Best advice. Do not buy this edition. They did not remaster or clean up the picture. They just slapped it on blu-ray. The picture is extremely grainy.	1.0	0

med_181172	The documentary is very interesting, especially since it was filmed in 1974 when the US had just gotten out of the Vietnam War. BUT, the Amazon Video is very poor in that the the Closed Captions (CC) for persons whose hearing is less than perfect is not synchronized with the movie. The CCs precede the words actually being spoken by about 30 seconds. Amazon: you have a reputation for quality products. Please make sure this issue is fixed immediately on this important historical documentary.	1.0	0

med_181176	This movie made my skin crawl. Why didn't the villagers just burn the damn area down to the ground killing all the blood-thirsty plants and be done with it. Of course, if they did that then we wouldn't get to see teenagers being tortured and getting their legs cut off with a blunt knife and no anesthesia. Geez, who wouldn't want to see that???	2.0	0

Star of the series is an average golfer and we get to follow him as, with some help from TGC, he works to lower his score. Followed up by breaking 90 and breaking 80.	4.0	1
med_181181	this review is on the blu ray disc of the movie - movie- 5 / 5 video- 5 / 5 audio- 5 / 5 need i say more... really impressed with both video and audio quality, best i've seen it look ' at home ' since veiwing it at the cinema all those many years ago. blu , unfortunately showed up all of the stunt doubles too clearly for my part, however this still is highly recommended.	5.0	1
med_181182	"Recommended by a friend and described as a ""quirky comical farce full of intriguing characters and a fast-paced storyline"". My personal opinion is it's not that interesting or entertaining, but it keeps you watching because of the A-list actors and stylized filming. Not bad enough to press the stop button, but certainly not a movie I would rave to friends about."	2.0	0

med_181187	We were turned off by the language, especially coming from the mouths of kids. It may be an accurate depiction of what typical southern boys say, and even more so of the adults, but the story could be well told without all the @#$%!!&^$$.	2.0	0
med_181188	At least it was a short movie so I only lost an hour and twenty odd minutes of my wife and I's lives. TERRIBLE	1.0	0
med_181189	The camera guy was terrible and unconvincing, every time he spoke i was thrown out of the movie. It does have its suspenseful scenes but the camera guy was the main issue with the movie. Whenever he spoke it sounded like he was reading a script and his character was very unlikeable. Felt no empathy when he died at the end. But the other characters do occasionally make up for it, but overall i would recommend 10 cloverfield lane over this movie any day.	2.0	0

med_181217	Meh. Not enough character development for any character in the movie, and for the third installment of a trilogy, it introduced a lot of new characters. Apocalypse was not intimidating as a villain. Jennifer Lawrence running around as herself instead of Mystique was just lazy and unnecessary considering Mystique doesn't have those hard-to-apply scales anyway. Quiksilver's slow-motion scene had much better effects in Days of Future Past. They did a good job casting Storm, Psylocke, and Jubilee.	2.0	0

med_181249	From the trailer, and with all of the awesome actors in the movie, I thought it would be upbeat and funny. I will say, some of the conversations between Blythe Danner and the pool guy were very right on as far as reality; however, sometimes it's nice to escape reality even for 90 minutes. Overall I have to say the movie was depressing from the get go.	2.0	0
med_181250	I love the author, love the character, love Katherine Heigl, but really did not like this movie. The casting was way off and the editing was horrific.

Did the casting director read the books?	2.0	0

Tom Felton (a very young Tom) and the guy who played Mr. Weasley. He was the exterminator. There was one part that I thought was falling down funny. I won't say what it was but it had to do with Tom Felton. He must have been about 7 or 8 years old in this movie. His name was Peagreen Clock.	1.0	0

The only interesting point was when the GIANT naked woman with the humongous swinging boobies, thunderous thighs and long haired hairy snatch entered and ate the entire boy in one gulp. The boy falls through her body and out her va je je' covered in slim turning into something special. Still uncertain of what that something special meant in the movie.

med_181326	This movie is full of inaccuracies and seemed to just want to cash in on Freddie's death. The film states it was based on articles, etc., so need I say more?

If you liked Shaun of the Dead or Scary Movie or others like that, then I would really recommend you give this one a chance.	4.0	1
med_181333	There is no real story line or plot . They don't even really use the beautiful bodies or take the stripping far enough.	2.0	0
med_181334	The Story is good but too much dialogue like a British film. More of talking than action.	4.0	1

med_181339	"The idea that there would be an animate presence in a air filled balloon-like creature isn't new -- just think: ""The Red Balloon."" What makes this offering amazing is not one layer of personalities and characters, but many, in the community of a larger-life-and-world-saving storytelling. That might be defined in the core metaphor of many cartoon mythologies -- toys that come to life. Plastic friends that do save the universe. Perfect for a 5 year old. Or me, a 60+year old."	5.0	1
med_181340	"The quality/clarity of both videos is poor. Although viewable, the picture is fuzzy and not clear. Again, you can see and follow the story. It's just very poor quality viewing. The second movie is a collie, but the name is Shep and is not ""LASSIE""."	2.0	0
med_181341	This was made in the desperate hope to piggy back on the star wars success but instead it was made on a credit card budget by ametures. Almost as good as watching a blind T-Rex wrap Christmas gifts.	1.0	0
med_181342	This is such a bad movie. And not bad in a funny or cheesy way. It's just bad. The acting and dialogue between characters was naseuating. I kept watching and waiting for something good to happen and nothing did. There is no action in this movie at all. They tried to make this movie a psychological thriller, but it fails miserably. Save your money and don't buy this movie unless you need something to bore you to sleep.	1.0	0
med_181343	Note that season one is the only DVD containing the word 'Complete' in the title. Every other season has been butchered to remove many Jim Nabors's songs, to say nothing of changing other music, etc. It is really hard, frankly, for me to watch these episodes, because I'm just waiting for the next editing massacre, as opposed to simply enjoying what should be great entertainment.	2.0	0

med_181349	This movie has plenty of special effects of the blob dissolving people it comes across. A space mission carrying a biological germ warfare test comes back to earth. It carries the results of this test which is the blob. I found the movie to be interesting. I recommend this movie for the special effects alone, plus the plot. It has plenty of people being bent into all kinds of shapes as they are captured by the blob.	5.0	1

The most depressing movie I ever saw too. I had to have a couple strong ones after this bomb. Avoid at all costs. Guys, if you're looking for a movie to get your chick in the mood, this ain't it. She'll either be in mood to argue or cry her eyes out."	1.0	0
med_181359	I LOVED the Doctor Who reboot. I grew up watching the Tom Baker series on public TV, so I was familiar with the story's background. Christopher Eccleston as the newly regenerated Doctor does a great job.

med_181362	For Instant Video watchers, this is the new version, not the original. We were very disappointed that Amazon did not make this clear in the video description or trailer.

med_181365	This was the most compelling movie! I was so moved by the characters it was easy to forget that I was watching an interpretation of their lives, not the actual people whom the story in based on. It should have earned more Academy Awards than it did, but at least Eddie Redmayne was recognized for his extraordinary performance. Felicity Jones is equally magnificent, and their synergy keeps you glued to the screen, despite the difficult subject matter. This is not one to miss!	5.0	1

med_181512	A breakdancing fight club, you ask? How can you go wrong with such a solid premise? This is how you go wrong...Battle B-Boy. 90+ minutes of some porn-bad acting, interspersed with some pretty bad fight scenes. If you're hanging out with a group of people, this movie might make a fun group event, if your group is into watching not great movies and laughing at them, but that's about it.	2.0	0
med_181513	I made the mistake of starting with the move IP Man, and then getting interested and doing research on Master Ip... This movie was just hard to watch, and I am a fan of kung fu movies. To be completely honest I only made it about half way through this movie and maybe it gets much better in the second half, but I was so uninterested in the movie by half way though that I gave up.	2.0	0

med_181515	I was a fan of this show as a kid and it led me to discover the Tintin books. I tried finding this anywhere for ten years before the big Speilberg/Jackson movie came out. When it was announced, I knew these would finally be getting a DVD release after so many years. The wait is worth it, as the episodes go in a nice order and the seasons are cheap to buy to boot! We watched these with my stepchildren and now have them hooked on Tintin too!	5.0	1

med_181517	Overly cliched plot. Derivitive of too many folk tales to go into. Poorly acted. The choreography of fights is.... Um.... Without art. The first twenty minutes of the film are the best. It then dissipated into a cliched unexciting, disjointed mess. The princess has beautiful lips.	1.0	0

med_181553	I was a fan of the comic book but could not stomach the television show. The writing was morelike a daytime soap opera than a cop drama. I found the lead actresses vocals to be grating and her eyebrows looked like two wooly caterpillars fighting. Both were very distracting. The lead villian was less than sinister and cartoon like. The only standout character was Ian Nottingham. There were far to many music video montages where she would ride her motocycle or they played medieval stock footage. Overall could not keep my attention.	2.0	0

I recently show it at a jail meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous and they were very moved by it. I had to show it in two parts because of the meeting time aloud, but they were there the following week to watch the ending.

med_181608	I read and liked the first book. The first several episodes of season 1 were just ok. Whole episodes devoted to cruelty and sex is a tragedy. What a waste of time and money. Some things are better left for the imagination. Claire uses words and phrases that no one in Gaelic speaking Scotland would even begin to understand-especially in the 18th century. Unrealistic and above all - TRASHY! It is a shame because the scenery and costumes are gorgeous.	1.0	0
med_181611	Night of the Werewolf was written and directed by Naschy himself in 1980, after gothic horror had out gone of style. Unlike Hammer's last movies of the 70's, however, this film is gorgeous. Naschy plays a tormented werewolf under the power of the vampiric Elizabeth Bathory.

But my 20 year old son recommended it as a good movie, so my wife and I decided to watch it one Saturday morning. It was a good movie. Fun and a little inappropriate, and watching a talking racoon was not as bad as I imagined. And I loved the 70's music theme. Actually look forward to the next movie.	4.0	1

med_181680	I ordered this DVD and had it shipped to North Carolina. It did not play on my DVD player and when I contacted the company they said it was my responsibility to check and see if it's compatible in the US or just in Europe.

Plus, one of the DVDS inside, the holder it was in is cracked and broken. And all of the writing on the DVDS is in some different laungage, maybe I missed that in the details about it but I am not happy with this purchase.	1.0	0

The movies had until now, took great pains to follow and depict the most essential parts of JK Rowlings amazing tale. This one was a big miss. Deathly Hallow part I was awesome, and I am counting down the days, minutes, and hours, until part II premieres.	2.0	0

Even though this was a different change of pace, Deadpool wasn't up to par IMO."	1.0	0

med_181937	The movie was not at all what I thought it would be, it is certainly not for children. I don't like the morale of the movie, it is violent, sexual, antireligious in my opinion.

med_181942	The man is a HERO. The movie does not translate well into English. Additionally, there were so many 'irrelevant' scenes that added nothing but confusion to the storyline. And so, from a director's point of view, those scenes should have been sent to the cutter's floor. What I liked was the insertion of real life footage from those days. I'm checking out other movies on Jerzy's life, for he WAS a hero ... and a saint.	2.0	0

med_181957	A couple of tense moments but they pass quickly. The film ends on a bizarre and confusing note that leaves the viewer with more questions than answers.

med_181958	This is an exceptionally well written and performed movie. Touching, romantic and often extremely funny.

med_181961	I'm not sure if this is a Hallmark movie, but it sure seems like it. It's got everything a 'grown up' Disney fan loves: fairytale life, romance, cute little places in the city, and a happy ending. I bought this as a gift to a friend and she loved it.

med_181985	Season one of this show blew me away, I loved it, however they seem to be moving more and more towards the same old guns, explosions and no police in sight formula that makes up any american action show.

The cast is the one element that remains positive.	4.0	1

med_182007	Maybe he needed the dough? Whatever it is, this movie along with the other one he made (The Marksman) are pretty bad, 90 minute standard-action crap-ola. 7 Seconds was a little better, but whoa the stench rotted my entertainment center for days. Sorry Wesley. For what it's worth; your not a bad actor. But your agent is selling you off to the lowest bidder. Good luck..	2.0	0

med_182047	This is just repackaged karma. The idea that there is some mystical force that governs the quality of your participation in life is a joke.

Was looking forward to Baraka as well but was wholly disappointed. Baraka has several scenes with pretty visuals, but falls far short of what you get with the Quatsi series. Baraka comes across as a hastily made cheap knock-off of Quatsi. If having a ""Rolecks"" watch makes you happy, you'll probably enjoy ""Baraka"" too."	2.0	0

While the series has moved into more surreal humor by this point, there's still an overal warmth that gives it a redeeming quality. The only complaint is the packaging the series used for this season and several of the surrounding seasons. Simply put, it's a major annoyance and feels very cheap.	5.0	1
med_182123	Thank goodness for venues like this where we can read customer comments. I'm in a hurry, see it out on blu ray, and wasn't even thinking about the different versions - that I already own. That seems significantly disengenuous that they wouldn't at this point have both versions on the same trilogy package. Dreadful conduct. At this point, I don't think I need any blu ray issue of LOTR.

med_182167	Nightmare Honeymoon starreed Dack Rambo and was released in 1974. It is a gritty tough B-Film, of one man's revenge when he is attacked, and his wife raped after they witness a murder on their honeymoon. Not for the squeamish. Dack rambo fans will like this the most.	5.0	1

med_182169	I love the selection of things to do on these three DVDs. Two of them are nicely geared for beginning to learn yoga and working out in having a couple of levels and how the moves work while the third DVD is more of a workout that is good to work with in a more general way with different pacing. Very pleased with this set and how much I have to exercise with on them.	5.0	1

med_182172	This was a very interesting movie and one I had missed in my earlier selection of movie purchases. It is a later Cary Grant but still the same unique style and finesse. His charm comes through even though the plot is somewhat convoluted. The movie appears to reflect issues of marriage and fidelity for a changing society. It is a delightful romp into a more serious issue in a way only Cary Grant can deliver.	4.0	1

med_182190	This Film spent more time praising the Dallas Cowboys then presenting the 49ers. There should have been more details about the the great players over time and coaches for the 49ers and less story line on Dallas.

med_182195	One of the most important movies made in recent years. And it was enough to get a Vatican reaction. I was in the seminary when this was going on. It was a worse horror story on the inside. Everyone needs to see this movie. See why it won Best Picture of 2015.	5.0	1
med_182197	Even as a McCartney fan I found this boring. It shows Paul walking the streets of New York showing Himself as a man of the people. Hard to do when you're a celebrity . Even the backstage banter got old fast. Didn't shed any light on 9/11 other than to let us know Paul was there. Buy the concert for N.Y.C. and skip this.	2.0	0
med_182198	This was my favorite movie of 2015. I've now seen it three times and was spell-bound by the acting and the action each time. The ending is unforgettable and stays with you for days. Bradley should have won the best actor award at the Oscars. Only because the left wing liberals are against war, did he lose. I did not see this as the best war movie of all time, but perhaps as the best peace movie.	5.0	1

This movie is not only not suited to qualify as a horror film, it is in reality a boring film. Nothing interesting happens in this film. It is about as thrilling as watching paint dry. If i could give it 0 stars, I'd give it -5 stars. DO NOT BUY OR RENT."	1.0	0

med_182216	Orphan Black is one of the BEST shows on tv. If you are not watching it, you are seriously missing out on the some fantastic acting, intrigue, and good writing. You want a show that takes you to the next level, a show that leaves you wanting more, and a show that keeps your mind engage, well then, this is it. Give Orphan Black a chance to make you feel good about spending some time in front of your tv. It's worth it!	5.0	1
med_182217	It's old, so the quality is a little scratch and outdated. However! The depictions of the countryside and villages in The Cotswolds is spot on! I have been to many of these villages, both in the 80s and again in 2009. Felt like I was back!	4.0	1

med_182231	Amazing views, excellent photography good narration (several Spanish locales). I purchased it for my granddaughter and after watching it, have decided to purchase the original blu ray BBC's Planet Earth to enjoy the full production. Certainly some scenes might generate a level of sadness, but the documentary presents real life and, whenever necessary, children should be educated and guided in this regard. In my opinion Disney should have clearly warned about these kind of scenes.	5.0	1
med_182232	Usually reliable Criterion here does a great disservice to a classic movie. The dark mood created by Robert Krasker's famous black and white photography is wrecked by a transfer that is too bright and without the proper contrast. Those who remember the great look of this movie from seeing it in the theatre will be disappointed.	2.0	0

I liked the camera angles, the shots, the lighting, but just not the movie."	2.0	0

I wish it wasn't taking up 'space' on some of the premium channels I get on HBO. Really if you are actually thinking of buying this, DON'T. Rent a documentary about Motley Crue, or maybe read a book about the great 80's glam rock movement. Much more interesting."	1.0	0
med_182241	I consider myself a self proclaimed movie critic. I have watched many movies good, alright & bad but this was one of the WORST movies I have seen, it just did not make any sense, lack of transition, lack of storyline, the comedic actors were just silly...not funny at all.

But I can't recommend this release from ""Artiflex."" it was obviously converted from a vhs cassette and looks just awful: grainy picture, terrible sound, even occasional tracking artifacts like strips of rainbow color moving up the screen. A staggeringly lazy package. I question whether the company actually has the rights to this film. They certainly don't have an actual print to work from."	2.0	0

med_182253	This is one of my absolutely favorite Christmas classics to watch. I love this rendition of a Christmas Carol. I also love that it has Pluto's Christmas Tree short and two of Donald Duck's shorts after it. I just wish the snowball fight with Donald and his nephews was also included. It (along with Pluto's Xmas Tree) used to be played before it when I was growing up. (That is the only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5.)	4.0	1
med_182254	The young actor in this does a fine job in a difficult role. The story is predictable and addresses some serious issues with a little less care and effort than I would have liked. Any of the sub plots could have been developed into great movies of their own. It is disappointing that they were treated so casually in preference to the underdeveloped plot that wasn't.	2.0	0

med_182284	What I thought was a romantic movie turned out to be a horror. A man visits the home that a relative left him in her will. It seems like the first night was one of discovery - another man was locked in a small room unable to speak and is fearful. Shocking ending.	2.0	0

med_182333	No, not at all lol. Honestly, I gave it five stars to counter all the ridiculous one star reviews. Not saying that it was epic but considering that it was written and directed by a 24 year old using popular YouTube personalities on a low budget, it was pretty darn good. There are far far worse movies out there with much larger production value that ended up sucking (Starship Troopers, Water World). So read all the one star reviews and then watch the movie and be pleasantly surprised.	5.0	1
med_182334	The series is one of the oldies, but goodies that is still entertaining after many years. Much better written and acted than any of the current US TV shows. We are slowly working our way through from the beginning to the end of the series. You quickly pick up the dialog and accent.	5.0	1

med_182347	I expected to watch a film about a person's love of nature. Instead, Reese does nothing but complain, groan , take drugs and whore around. If there is a story, it is lost in the endless series of flash backs that ruin any narrative flow. Roger Ebert said that in order to like a movie, the viewer has to like the main character. I found Reese's character to be loathsome.	1.0	0
med_182348	This film came highly recommended and I can now take opposition to that notion. Acting was better than average but the story felt stale and there were no redeeming qualities I could find from it. Just because Del Toro inks his name on a project doesn't make it a winner.	2.0	0

I had always wanted to go see her in concert, but missed the opportunity. Throughout every song, Aguilera's vocals were on point. Her stage settings were intricate and fun. Also, her dancers bought a lot of energy to her overall performance. This dvd is a great buy.	5.0	1

med_182363	While it started a little slow the background set the stage for a fun, thoughtful and touching story about following your heart and doing the right thing, neither of which always works or always happens.

med_182369	I know alot of people who loved Babe were shocked and appalled by the sequel, but it really is an excellent movie. Yes it is a bit darker, but there is nothing truly inappropriate or shocking in the movie. View it with an open mind and you will be rewarded.	5.0	1

med_182373	Ugh! Hated this film. Two rather awful old men and a bevy of young beautiful women as scenery. Obviously a male script writer. Best character was Caine's daughter in the movie--well played and very realistic (but why are they sleeping in the same bedroom??? Kind of stranger. One of the worst movies I've ever seen--slow, boring, and kind of creepy--also, badly directed.	2.0	0

med_182411	I loved this workout, it got your heart pumping and made you feel super sexy!

med_182412	I liked this season alot it introduces the characters nicely and it follows the comics somewhat closely. The only thing that kept it from receiving a five star rating was the voice acting for Ranma's character. I didn't like that fact that he sounds younger than he is portrayed to be. But I eventually got used to it. So I would still recomend it to anyone who likes mild humor.	4.0	1
med_182413	I've gotta say that I was pretty disappointed in this film. I wasn't expecting much going in, but it left me wanting more in many aspects of the film.

Oh, and the accents are horrible, especially Paltrow, which surprised me because she pulled ""Sliding Doors"" off really well. Make it is because this is an era movie. Go for the ""Emma"" movie version with Kate Beckinsale. At least she is more believable rather than going through the motion."	1.0	0

med_182420	"This movie could have been good if scenes like Murphys relationship with the ""main"" guy was more focused upon. She seemed all hurt about what happened between them but there was no relationship to be hurt about. There are a few funny and sad moments which is why the film is not completly horrible. The bottom line is that there were meaningless minutes of nonsense and not enough emphasis on important parts."	2.0	0

med_182434	The picture quality is absolutely fantastic. It's a great set that sounds and looks perfect. However this Blu-ray loses a star for a real lack of features.

med_182458	This was a very weak sequel to the original story. As many others have commented, this was simply a rehash of the original story, but with a poorly written screenplay, no character development, and poor overall execution. This should never have been made.	1.0	0

The fat blasting 1 minute workouts and mix of the workouts keep it interesting.	4.0	1

med_182522	It probably was an OK movie when it came out. I remember liking it as a child. Unfortunately Spencer Tracy was not a Steve Martin so the movie is much more restrained and not that funny. Steve Martin's remake is the new classic. There are other Spencer Tracy movies worth watching, I would skip this one.	2.0	0

med_182526	As a beginner I found the DVD to be quite light on tips or the art of playing in general. There are questions from the audience (probably about 6 or seven questions in total!) interspersed with Wilkerson actually playing with a band. It might be more useful if you are interested in watching and hearing him play.	2.0	0

med_182552	Wonderfully funny film with a great ensemble cast. On a technical note: the film was shot as digital video and processed with a film look for the previously released DVD. For some reason, this new release has not been processed in the same manner and has a rather flat look characteristic of its digital video origins. That really doesn't detract from the enjoyment, but it can be a bit jarring if you are accustomed to the look of the old Fox DVD.	5.0	1

med_182555	People please. This is a tribute movie paying tribute to the very special men who protect our freedom. It is not a good movie, there is no plot. I think it was mainly made to highlight the names of men who have died for us. But the movie and the acting are not very good. It is a bit like a video game.	1.0	0

I had never seen the film before buying it and I couldn't stop thinking about it for weeks after viewing it. No spoilers, but the ending may be the most disturbing thing I've seen or felt while watching a mystery.	5.0	1

med_182568	Kept waiting for it to get better. It never did and if anything got worse. I wouldn't recommend it to an enemy. Or Psychopath. No plot worth watching. We could only watch the first 30 minutes before giving up - especially as the over use of the 'f' word was grating on my nerves. Waste of money to amazon for this one.	1.0	0
med_182572	The Bourne Trilogy on blu-ray is amazing! I kept hearing about the Bourne series for a while and wanted to see for my self if it was as good as I was told. It was better! If you want a action/thriller with an amazing plot this is it. I looked for a long time to decide which set I wanted to get and this one does not disappoint. Between watching the Mission Impossible trilogy or this one I definitely choose this one.	5.0	1
med_182573	I felt like I was watching a B movie. Julianne Moore was a terrible replacement for Jodie Foster, and it just felt like the entire time they were just trying to show you something else to gross you out instead of creating a better story.	1.0	0

med_182584	This Mockumentary is so hilarious. The funniest part in the movie is the exorcist part, I'm still laughing.

Which to me is so dumb because it really is hilarious! Joaquin Phoenix is awesome :)	4.0	1

med_182607	This movie was a complete disaster. I have been a long time fan of Sean Connery, he is one of my all-time favourite actors, but it is beyond my comprehension why he accepted the role in this really bad movie. The original avengers was one of the best series ever produced. Most of my lunch breaks at university were spent watching Patrick MacNee and Diana Rigg and they were extremely enjoyable times. This attempt at reviving interest in The Avengers has failed dismally.	1.0	0

med_182656	I'll usually add a movie to my library if I've seen it and really liked it. That is the case with the Bradley Cooper film.

med_182666	For the mid 90's disaster movie craze, this one is a stand out. I got the Blu-Ray version and I have to say it really did not look much different than an upconverted DVD. The picture was great, but not quite what I would expect from this new format. For this genre of disaster/weather movies, this really is one to have in your collection. The 4 star rating is for a bit of disappointment in the video transfer.	4.0	1

med_182673	As someone of Russian heritage, I'm always interested in seeing how Soviet/Russian versions of history are produced for film. THIS is utter garbage. Take the worst Sylvester Stallone movie (Rambo, refighting Vietnam), add Bruce Willis explosions, insert agonizingly long and multiple slow-motion scenes, change the actors to heroic Russians and you have this turd of a movie.

med_182697	Not possible to watch in Europe due to Region restrictions.

med_182713	I enjoyed this movie and thought it was quite clever at some points, but I can see why it wasn't a box office smash. It's hard to categorize, perhaps because it's more intellectual than most action films. Armie Hammer does a good job with his character, which seems a little better written than other roles in the movie. If you like your action to be artsy (expensive clothes, great hair, fine wine and fancy locations), check this film out.	4.0	1

med_182854	This was a fun piece, maybe a little too fun for its own good. Romantic comedy and dark horror concepts are balanced very oddly in this little gore-free creeper. Some people will say that the will-they-won't-they comic banter between Aurelia Riley's Sarah and Patrick Flanagan's too-eager-to-please Tommy gets out of hand and upstages the horror. They'll say it's really two different movies. But after a little consideration I decided that I liked the unorthodox mix.	4.0	1
med_182856	I just love that sassy, sophisticated, sarcastic, smart Veronica! The dialog is witty and the plots are engaging.

Can't wait to see the recently released movie!	5.0	1
med_182857	This is a nice feel good movie but I was expecting to cry- in the good way. It wasn't that moving though, yet I feel that if written slightly different it could have raised alot of emotions in me. Overall, a very nice story. I would recommend it as a mood lifter, a family film, or if u are the type who just loves a nice positive movie.	4.0	1
med_182859	The title is misleading, the dvd cover synopsis is misleading, there is no rare footage of the REAL Bruce Lee to be found in the pic...only footage of the clones doing a poor job of exploiting the Little Dragon. A sad reminder of how Bruce's name and legacy was exploited by cold-hearted hustlers. GARBAGE!	1.0	0

med_182862	Not the original screened in South Africa in the 1970s-80s. This one has been dubbed with fake voice-overs to make it understandable to international audiences. Not the original (funnier) local South African accents. Some of the original footage from the first movie missing (e.g. guys struggling to get furniture through altered controls on automatic bank doors). Sound quality is rather poor, possibly due to transition from screen (film) to video/ DVD.	2.0	0
med_182863	I do understand some of the valid points being tried to made, but using those to ignore or completely justify the other bad points he made is disingenuous.

med_182876	Very interesting. DVD would not play. Said it was for Regions 2 and 4. I have never seen anything like this before. Unfortunately I viewed (tried to) the movie more than a month past purchase, so I guess I'm stuck with it. I bought it from Rare Waves Imports.

med_183048	I ordered this product/DVD, and it said that it was in English, Czech, and Mandarin, but it is not, just in Chinese. I have to get English or at least English dub, as my eyes are bad and cannot see to read as fast as the dialog is going. I love the Asian cinema, but simply cannot do sub titles any longer. I don't know if this is Amazons fault or a sellers, but I am not happy.......at all!	1.0	0

med_183056	The acting was average at best, with Penn being the worst. His sad father bit was completely unbelievable. The score was very distracting as it did not fit the movie at all.

med_183057	Bad effects, bad dialogue, poorly thought out storyline. They could have done SOOOOO much better. Perhaps the biggest cinematic disappointment of my life.

med_183097	DO NOT BUY THIS PEOPLE. You might as well download all the movies illegally off the internet, burn them to a disk, and print out some dvd cover art and stick on there, cause that is exactly what this is. Need proof? These movies are licensed by different companies, therefore it is impossible for them to all be released together in one package.	1.0	0

med_183099	The case the dvds come in is flimsy and worthless and all the dvd cases look the exact same from the side so if you have multiple seasons you can't tell what disc is from what season and you just can't tell one disc from another by looking at the cases. Doesn't make me want to collect them at all, just makes me want to buy them to watch one time then sell.	2.0	0
med_183100	1. All the films in one set for the first time. 2. Blu-Ray format. 3. It pisses off a couple of fanboys who actually care whether Greedo or Han shoot first. Which this makes me laugh. These films have been number 1 on my list to be put on Blu-Ray format since Blu-Rays release, and here it is. A product thats 8 months a way from it's release date, and I can still say that was the easiest 5 stars Ive ever given something.	5.0	1
med_183102	Only one disk and 4 movies were included, I returned the item so obviously I wasn't too happy with the purchase.

med_183104	A stunning visual tour of various crop circle sights, and very interesting interviews with the people connected to them. The things these people have to say...it's just so amazing! Crop circles are clearly a form of communication. I believe that people are so drawn to them because they feel the need to communicate with those that created them. I feel like this DVD brought me closer to knowing who or what they may be, & just seeing the people that have experienced them makes me feel more connected than before	4.0	1
med_183105	I had to return this item because it wasn't suited to play in U.S. DVD players. I contacted the seller, who was really great about responding to me really quickly, and offering a refund for my return. Hopefully I can find a DVD that's U.S. playable, since I really love this movie.	2.0	0

med_183113	This is a good program to supplement the 3 times a week we attend Silver Sneakers classes locally. The discs stress balance, strengthening and stretching, all necessary to keep supple as we age. I believe seniors of any age can benefit from the exercises, either all or some of them. It is beneficial to be able to do them at home at your own pace and learn the correct way to do each exercise without the tension of having to keep up with a live class.	4.0	1
med_183114	I never thought I would be able to find this old movie so when I saw it here at Amazon I had to grab it.

med_183141	The inddor walk is perfect for beginners, it is simple to follow and the moves are not stressful on joints etc. If you are an intermediate excerciser like myself, and you are worried about the reviews that say this workout is too easy, try adding ankle weights and weighted gloves during this workout. It will increse the intensity level. I was very pleased with this workout from my favorite excercise instructor.	5.0	1

med_183143	This is a reductionist fantasy based on an alternate-universe version of the Balkan conflict. The acting is horrible, the camerawork is TV-quality and totally uncreative, and the story is held together with spit. Respect yourself, don't watch this.	1.0	0
med_183144	This movie was glacially slow, with forced dialogue, and almost nonexistent humor. Without giving away the ending, let's just say there isn't any character development. Don't let the 4 star ratings fool you. This movie is a stinker.	1.0	0

med_183160	I'm on a Tom Hardy kick and so I had to buy this movie. Love a good period piece and one that involves the Prohibition and gangsters is only a bonus. A must watch for anyone looking for a good movie night. Hardy, Shia Lebeouf and Jessica Chastain are all great. $5 well spent!	4.0	1

med_183201	I love all those terrible movies on sci-fi about giant monsters and natural disasters gone wild. That being said, I was expecting a quality ride from Sean Bean and others in this cast. It was good escapism, but there is something lacking in the telling of the story. Individual performances were well done, but I don't think the story flowed as a quality film should. I would put it in the same weekend afternoon time slot on sci-fi with Zena.	2.0	0

med_183222	well this movie we thought might be a good one to add to our 3D collection--- Sorry but we will probably never watch this again-- It is not exciting and the dvd had some delays during the 3D version- Save your money and just rent it,if you have to see it.	2.0	0

med_183227	Although there is some good characterizations of the leaders of both families, the film doesn't really tell the truth of what happened. As the 3x great grandson of Randall McCoy (played by Steve Forrest) I hope a movie will one day come out that shows the feud in an accurate way.	2.0	0

med_183236	The audio for Halloween 4 goes out of sync halfway through the film. Anchor Bay, the rights owner for that entry, is aware of the issue but reuses to fix it, which is a disgrace considering the price of this product. They are also falsely stating that the issue was present on previous releases of the film, which is not true.	1.0	0

med_183243	I'm wonder if the movie other people were reviewing was the same Day of the Dolphin that I just watched. The movie I saw was dreadfully boring, horribly stiff, badly written, acted & especially badly directed. This film makes me rethink the idea that Mike Nichols was a good director. The ONLY good thing about this movie were the dolphins.	1.0	0

med_183252	As a first time watcher motivated only by a planned trip to Cong, Ireland, I have to report that the movie has not aged well. Not one of John Wayne's better movies to begin with, but marred by stereotypes: the Irish as argumentative drunken simple folks, women as the weaker sex that need a man to care for them. And in reality, not much evidence of Cong in the movie scenery.	2.0	0
med_183253	I am not sure why this film received such poor critical reviews. I think it was very good, although definitely a bit of a downer. Heart-wrenching but convincing acting from all involved, Catherine Keener is especially wonderful (or awful, if you're talking about her character) in this.	5.0	1
med_183254	Cinematography of China is of travelogue quality. Storyline is uneven and character development spotty and sometimes faltering. Only exception is Diana Riggs spot on performance as mother superior. Story is slow, bordering on boring. For the viewing public consider it two hours of Chinese water torture.	2.0	0

med_183310	Nice guitar playing and singing form Neil but the video looks like it was shot on a mobile phone camera! It is absolutely atrocious and sometimes you can barely make out Neil's face such is the poor quality of video.

med_183314	This movie was astonishingly dumb. It was a lot like Inception in that it really thinks it's clever and deep, which it is if you're 12 years old. If it had been marketed as a comedy, I would have given it three stars, but sadly everyone in the movie isn't kidding. Movies this bad make you question the intelligence of the people who agree to make them, which is too bad, because I really like the cast, particularly Emily Blunt.	1.0	0

The series is both action-filled and emotionally satisfying, with terrific performances by David Carradine reprising his role as Kwai Chang Caine, and Chris Potter as his son of many passions. Excellent supporting cast,too, and a soundtrack by Jeff Danna that is exceptionally fine. Now that the original 1970s KUNG FU is complete on DVD, it's time for the sequel series that has its own charms. Warner Bros., please speed up the process!	5.0	1

I wish the show could have continued for another season or two, or longer--other shows have survived the departure of major stars--see ""Law and Order"" or ""NCIS""--and the writing team on JAG was solid. I don't regret buying this season; I do regret there were no further seasons."	4.0	1
med_183326	Very enjoyable, classic film. So nice to see such an enthralling storyline developed with great performances by a superb ensemble cast .. and no cgi! The Hitchcock touch and Tellulah's charm are wonderful but Walter Slezak and William Bendix steal the show.	4.0	1
med_183327	"More than the horrid shaky camera and fast edits, I was annoyed at the total lack of originality here. They literally duplicate the final shots of ""Road Warrior"", ""Apocalypse Now"" and the 1984 ""Terminator"" itself (not to mention dozens of ""Transformer"" shots.) The resistance should not have subs, jets, and choppers. They should have been grimy scavengers with pipe bombs. Skynet turned out to be a very bland place. WAY too much CGI."	2.0	0

med_183381	Quite possibly the best dramatic film on the subject of Native Americans. Bruce Beresford offers an unapologetic view of Algonquian and Iroqouis Indians in the early era of European colonization. Unfettered by any politically correct agenda, Beresford delivers a portrayal that is poignant, terrifying, and moving. Georges Delerue's hauntingly beautiful score is masterful. Lothaire Bluteau, Aden Young, and August Schnellenberg deliver outstanding performances. An absolute must-see.	5.0	1

med_183396	William Powell is a classic himself. Love the old fashioned clean humor and double entendres that pepper the scripts. Wonderful light fun.	5.0	1
med_183398	"I loved the story, it was easy to get wrapped-up in the twists and turns of Austin era England; and four hours (episodes) passed before I knew it. Tom Hollander rocks! The transformation from the guy I saw in ""The Night Manager"" to this character really made me appreciate his range as an actor. My love for Allison Brie just grows. The only reason I did not give this five stars is the introductions from Julian Fellowes; he is no Alistair Cooke."	4.0	1
med_183400	The best comedy I have seen in years. I literally laughed my butt off!	5.0	1
med_183401	Seen this movie many times. Had to test out my new kindle to see how movies play. It worked just perfectly. Will try out other prime movies.	5.0	1
med_183403	The title is not as thrilling as appears, the movie plot is really quit terrible, it's like a TV show it's that tame.	2.0	0
med_183404	Terrible movie. Only reason to watch this is to see Scarlet Johanson naked	1.0	0
med_183405	If it was a little more like the show and not a avant garde sexual debauchery ride, then it could have been a little shorter.	2.0	0
med_183406	I've seen video games with better plots. He takes out the Organized Crime Syndicate because they killed his dog? And to do this, he head-shoots 20 or 30 bad guys in one scene. Really?	1.0	0
med_183408	This rates 4 stars because it was entertaining, good action sequences, and bang!! if I remember correctly dude was due to retire, yeah right.	4.0	1
med_183409	The video is onyl girls dancing, not explaining how to recreate the moves. The pace is too fast, especially for beginners.	1.0	0
med_183410	"Given that ""The Exorcist"" has existed as the Gold Standard for this genre for 40 years now, this movie was stunningly inferior. How can the producers, director, and writers live with such dreck (one gets to use a yiddishism when evaluating this movie)?"	2.0	0
med_183411	Some thing a little different. I thought that it was worth the time.	4.0	1
med_183412	Received quickly and on time as a Christmas gift for my two daughters (ages 5 and 2). They first watched this movie when it premiered on the Disney Channel and they were automatically hooked. Even my 2 year old knows and loves all the songs and characters. The DVD was brand new and works perfectly. I'm very happy that I ordered it from Amazon!	5.0	1
med_183415	BEWARE! This movie is NOT for children! We watched it based on theses Amazon reviews however it was violent and morbid and INCREDIBLY SAD! We (the parents ) were crying right along with our 4 & 6 year olds. IT BROKE OUR HEARTS :(	1.0	0
med_183416	Didn't know Eddie Albert could sing! Loved the story and history of the horses. A little cheesy but then some disney movies are.	5.0	1
med_183417	This is a captivating story with terrific acting. A great addition to my collection.	5.0	1
med_183418	I wasn't expecting more than a kids show but this has excellent Sci-Fi stories! 3 disks and 4:3 Fullscreen. Be careful when selecting episodes, there is an arrow in the lower right that switches the menu to reveal more episodes, don't miss out!.	4.0	1
med_183419	This should be included in any compendium of Sci Fi movies. It's a classic of the genre. Highly recommended. Watch it.	5.0	1
med_183420	"All Michael Bay films are garbage. He should be banned from making ""films""."	1.0	0
med_183422	Love this series. All the DVDs work and it shipped fast.	5.0	1
med_183424	I liked this series of detective stories alot. It was unique and very fun to watch. I liked the characters alot and the stories.	5.0	1
med_183425	Just plain great entertainment. Ever wonder why the better US TV shows are modeled after the Brits?......this is one of the reasons.	5.0	1
med_183426	This one has to be the Plan 9 From Outerspace of westerns ever made. About the only good critique one can give to it is that Alfred Hitchcock did some of his best work during this time because Selznick (who wrote the screenplay to this bomb) was too busy trying to finish this stinker and not interfere in Hitchcock's work.	1.0	0
med_183427	great story and cast but movie did not start until the last 25 minutes. Basic dialogue and very slow plot. Over dramatic.	2.0	0
med_183428	Funny movie I looked everywhere for it happy I found it on her	5.0	1
med_183430	I love Weird Al, but it wasn't as fun as his parodies. Sigh.	2.0	0
med_183431	Great and funny series about detective Nick Slaughter and his partner (and boss) Sylvie Girard. It's not for demanding audience. It's for relaxing! It's Great relax (don't think, just watch). Amazing tropical nature, wonderful girls, bad boys, more girls, Nick in shirt... I like this DVD, although i miss english subtitles and quality of DVD video (screen) could be better. Go Nick and Silvie, go..	4.0	1
med_183432	This video made all who heard it pause with beauty.	4.0	1
med_183433	Poorly done science fiction, and Jaden Smith performs pretty badly at that. His lisp was fun though, so he's got that going for him.	2.0	0
med_183434	I loved this movie when I was a kid and now my daughters love it today. I bought it and they sat right down and watched it from start to finish and if you know my kids having them sit still for 90 minutes is a miracle so this movie quickly has become one of their favorite movies and mine all over again.	5.0	1
med_183435	I read and had autographed Mama's Bank Account as a child. And raised my children by it. The movie is excellent!!	5.0	1
med_183436	I'm still grieving the loss and I watched this thing a week ago. If you're really tempted, go scrub your toilet instead. You'll have more fun and be happier in the end.	1.0	0
med_183437	I have to watch this one again - I had not seen it before.	4.0	1
med_183438	Quick yet super intense workout. Great for all levels. Started seeing results within the few 10 days of working out.	5.0	1
med_183439	Slow, Very Slow, Not a whole lot of continuity in plot	2.0	0
med_183440	This is the first of what I imagine will be many seasons. Don't expect ANY closure by this seasons end, but DO expect gratuitous amounts of...fan service. Ecchi: ladies doing battle resulting in compromising postures, armor breaking at just the right/wrong places, and free OVAs with more innuendo than a high school lunch conversation. Keep the tissues handy -- for nosebleeds. Decent artwork, B-rated English dubbing at best. A fun, if not socially awkward, item to have in one's collection.	4.0	1
med_183441	My wife said she will buy more from this instructor. Liked it very much.	4.0	1
med_183442	The plot was great and it had a bit for the whole family, small history/mythology for youth, battle and carnage for the more animal sided guys and a love story mixed in. great move	5.0	1
med_183443	A powerfully made movie, even more so when seen in Blu-ray. It remains a classic of modern war movies.	5.0	1
med_183444	"I am a native New Mexican, transplanted to the great Pacific Northwest. My heart will always be with the people and culture of New Mexico. This film truly captures the spirit of ""The land of enchantment"". Watch it and you will fall in love with New Mexico."	4.0	1
med_183445	I gave this movie four stars because of the message and the majority of the acting skills were excellent. Ashley Walters has talent. I saw one other movie he was in and he did an excellent job. I didn't know he was a rapper but he has great acting skills.	4.0	1
med_183446	this is an ok movie, no action so don't expect any....a few confusing parts but i guess its ok if you have run out of things to look at.	2.0	0
med_183447	These DVD's can only be used in Europe. Read the fine print!!! Why would you even be allowed to sell these in the United States????????	1.0	0
med_183448	My daughter loved it but I thought the story was broken, they could have put a little more into it.	4.0	1
med_183449	This movie had excellent slapstick humor. Also, there was some funny and serious material on relationships. I gave it four stars because it was too slow several times.	4.0	1
med_183450	I love all things related to the Zombie lore. I was a little disappointed with this movie. Parts where mildly amusing and funny, but overall I felt I wasted my money on this DVD. I felt the special effects just where not that good and the comedy got a little stale. Some of the things that went on with the main character where just too ridiculous for my taste. Maybe a fair rental but not worth the purchase price.	2.0	0
med_183451	Loved the series back then. Kinda dated by today of course but the stories were very well written. Incredible Hulk indeed. Bixby and Ferrigno were perfect for this. Now it's a classic.	4.0	1
med_183452	This movie has some cool music, but is pretty trite. I wanted to show it to my middle school music students, but it had too many un-funny sexual remarks in it to be appropriate. That's a shame , because the mentality it would attract would be middle school age. I wish that it were more appropriate for kids. The plot is pretty juvenile, but the jokes and curse words make it inappropriate for kids .	2.0	0
med_183453	Took me 3 shows to like it. Now I cant stop watching it. On to season 2, 3, 4, and 5.	5.0	1
med_183454	Another cute little kid with special powers movie -remember 'clifford' with martin short,same deal. Bruce willis as nypd det. John mccall...Wait a minute -that was 'diehard'. This movie was different-something about esp & ghosts.	2.0	0
med_183455	ABC, as do the other major networks, find it more profitable to produce cheap game shows like WIPEOUT, SHARK TANK and THE BACHELOR, leaving us with fewer choices. One of the few ways to enjoy quality TV these days is to buy them on DVD or other means. The major American TV networks are turning into money whores at our expense!	5.0	1
med_183457	The movie is good but its more of the same. What really bothers me is that I still had left like 3 hours on my rental when amazon took the movie out. In my playstation 3 said that is was unavailable to playback so I lost 3 hours of rental time and money!!!!	2.0	0
med_183459	A good action packed movie with humor. I enjoyed the tv series transporter, so I gave this movie a shot, and found out that I liked it a lot. The interplay between father and son was very enjoyable. If you have seen the cbc series the Republic of Doyle, you would most likely enjoy this movie as well.	4.0	1
med_183461	The acting is absolutely horrible. It's like watching a school project. How people gave this movie five stars is beyond. Trust me, don't waste your time on this.	2.0	0
med_183462	"The first feature-length compilation devoted to Stan and Ollie's silent classics, ""Laurel and Hardy's Laughing 20's"" (1965) is terrific fun. Perusing the Hal Roach studio vaults, producer Robert Youngson has assembled some of the team's finest moments from 1927 to 1929 - with Charley Chase, Edgar Kennedy and Max Davidson thrown in for good measure. A memorable display of silent-film comedy at its glorious peak."	4.0	1
med_183463	"The DVD is from 2010, but the information and the video itself is from the 1980's (or earlier)! For example, ""visit scenic Yugoslavia"" or discussion of the ""current Soviet Union."" The description of this DVD on Amazon is horribly misleading as it fails to mention this."	1.0	0
med_183464	I like this move but I feel likre there is something missing. Like there should be more to it. Overall it is ok.	4.0	1
med_183465	the worst Sherlock - EVER !!! the worst Dr Watson - EVER !!! the worst Inspector Lestrad- EVER !!! To sum it up-- the worst incarnation of the Sherlock Holmes in the history of film or TV.	1.0	0
med_183466	this is a wonderful movie, 5 stars. vivien was wonderful as she is in everything she does. she is a true classic beauty and a fine classic actress!	5.0	1
med_183468	There are some films that are like a crossover between this and Tootsie and my favorite one is The Tale of the Frog Prince episode of Shelley Duvall's Faerie Tale Theatre because it stars those 2 cross-dressing films' comedians, Robin Williams and Teri Garr	5.0	1
med_183471	I thought this would be a good movie since Tommy Lee Jones and John Goodman were in it but I was wrong. It was very disappointing.	2.0	0
med_183472	Much of the new liberation of the 60's was punctuated by distrust of institutions and a depressing fatalism. With this video, I had a chance to relive that.	2.0	0
med_183473	Such a great show. Wish it had went on for a couple more seasons.	5.0	1
med_183474	I like movies with suspense in them. I also like thriller movies. This one has this. Lou Diamond Phillips is great in this movie.	4.0	1
med_183475	Keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time!!	4.0	1
med_183476	I was very happy & over joyed to find this DVD that I watched when I was a kid. The amazing star cast was amazing & I never forgot the event of watching it on Cinnemascope. This has brought back a wonderful memory.	5.0	1
med_183477	Despite the terrific star power, off to a way-too-slow start that does not generate interest. Lots of stalling.	2.0	0
med_183478	The was a good Movie. There were times when I was sensitive to what happen however it was a very good Movie. I would recommend it for teachers to show it in 6th-12th grade History Classes.	4.0	1
med_183479	My set came on time. there is nothing wrong with any of the disks i wish season 1-5 would come out on blue ray.	4.0	1

med_183483	I didn't realize that it would be almost like watching a play, but it was still enjoyable	4.0	1
med_183484	we began to watch the series but soon were turned off by the unacceptable scenes and dialogue. At our age we don't enjoy seeing smarmy pictures and dirty dialogue. the younger generation will probably enjoy this series but it just isn't for us. peggy shuttleworth	1.0	0
med_183486	Watch if you want... B movie, plus a tad weird.	2.0	0
med_183487	Hate to say it, but this is a better telling of the original story. The Sci-Fi version seems more believable to me. Amazing characters. Long movie, but it's a mini-series after all. Great Saturday Afternoon Movie.	5.0	1
med_183488	It was for my son. He was satisfied with it. Thank you.	5.0	1
med_183489	Fast shipping, great price. My 13 year old loves this movie and I couldn't find it in the store. Ya'll made my life so much easier for a very small price! Thanks so much! Would definately use again! :)	5.0	1
med_183490	Although the show is comedic, this purchase was a waste of time because the format did not fit anything I tried to watch it on, being from another country. I was warned, so this was entirely my fault.	2.0	0
med_183491	I purchased this set as a gift for someone who is losing their hearing and needs to use the closed caption feature. Although the description and the packaging describe the DVDs as closed captioned, they are not. Very disappointing.	2.0	0
med_183492	Very good concert. Axl is on most of the time as well as the rest of the band. Blu-ray encode could be a bit better, noticed some noise and macro-blocking, but sound is good with a lot of options. The interviews weren't extraordinary or particularly interesting though. All in good, a good buy.	4.0	1

med_183507	Sorry, this review is not about the film itself, it's a classic. This disk is Region B and will not play on American Blu Ray DVD players. Why is it not specified that this Is Region B DVD and does not work in U.S. Blu Ray players? In small print on the back of the case is the only place this is shown. I received this as a Christmas gift and can't watch it. This information should at least be listed in the item details.	1.0	0
med_183509	I like the legal drama, but for my taste there is too much focus on the sexual escapades of the characters.	4.0	1

med_183522	Just didn't quite get anywhere. Good concept, not impressed with the execution. Will not recommend this movie to others. Sometimes too much can be left to the imagination.	2.0	0
med_183523	One of the worst movies ever! The plot went no where....and it did so really slowly. I'm shocked that some great actors would even consider a script like this, but we all have to make a living.	1.0	0
med_183524	VA veterans, staff & students love it...only complaint the video was of fair quality... perhaps reproduce for sale..OR I was sold a used one and paid the cost of a new one...hope that's not the case with Amazon's stainless reputation at this time!	4.0	1
med_183525	Movie was excellent but language accent was hard to understand, needed closed captioning to be understood. Surprise ending, at least for me.	4.0	1

med_183532	I loved this film the first time I saw it over 10 years ago, which is why I purchased it on DVD. It's full of action, romance, and dignity. It's easy to see why it's been a popular story in France for many years. Terrific on-screen chemistry between lead actors Juliette Binoche and Olivier Martinez.	4.0	1
med_183533	"For an episode that revolves around the stuff I don't like (UFO/aliens), I still enjoyed this one. Scully sees the huge flaw about Mulder and instead of constantly chastising him about it, she only contrasts his ""blinding"" belief with her defensive logic. More paranoia and new questions start to crop up in this one."	4.0	1
med_183535	I thouroughly enjoyed this film. This movie had so much humor and although I will admit that the first time I saw *Emma* I failed to find much humorous. A movie for people who find intelectual humor more to their enjoiment and not slapstick.	4.0	1
med_183536	Eh. Not what I expected. Just a long, outdated, snl skit. Turned it off half-way through. Will Ferrell tends to be like that for me tho. Couple of good scenes and the rest is just....stupid.	2.0	0
med_183538	I do this movie 5 stars far as good storyline and uniqueness	5.0	1
med_183539	"I write that headline not as a racial slur in anyway but to highlight some of the brilliant writing in this movie. Randolph Duke tells Mortimer Duke there is nothing wrong with Valentine (Murphy) to which Mortimer responds, ""of course there's something wrong with him, he's a Negro! ...probably been stealing since he could crawl."" The ridiculousness of that comment as well as the accurate social commentary it eludes to is flat-out brilliant and this movie is full of many similarly wonderful moments."	5.0	1

med_183556	Good idea I suppose. Not TOO original though. Scares were mainly created by anticipation and suspense rather than the actual ghosts which looked like normal people. Acting was pretty terrible at times.	2.0	0
med_183557	I Love Jeff Dunham, and everything he's done. I could watch all of his movies a hundred times. This, however, is GARBAGE. I don't think I laughed once, and I shut it off 1/2 way through. It's really unfortunate you can't return movies now-a-days because I feel like I just threw money away on this. Save yourself the time and money and just watch some old school Jeff Dunham instead.	1.0	0
med_183559	Bought this as a gift for my husband for Christmas as he's a huge SNL fan. We watched a few episodes, and what great memories, but had some boring scenes as well. Will have to see as we are able to watch more. Gotta love the old episodes though from the 70's-beats what's on SNL today!	4.0	1

med_183562	This film would have been much better if the two leads actually talked to each other, as friends this age would do incessantly. The acting is so very flat, it gets frustrating. Starts off nicely with the letters from abroad but they have trouble pulling off the live relationship.	2.0	0

med_183569	The film has an excellent cast led by John Cusack, one of my favorites. It appears that the director James Mangold began the film with a Bates Motel model, but he is not Hitchcock. Rather than following a single character, Mangold follows a tangled web of implausable characters. Don't waste your time watching Identity.	1.0	0
med_183570	I love this show and am thrilled to get this on DVD finally. I missed a lot of the past couple seasons so I can't wait until they come out as well. The best part is that the show is seamless. normally when they release tv shows, they fade to black for a few seconds where the commercials are usually inserted. In the stargate dvd's, it flows seamlessly. We watched about 7 episodes in one night when we first got it. :)	5.0	1

med_183577	I wish I'd rented this movie instead of buying it. I was looking forward to watching a beautiful love story unfold between Audrey Hepburn and Fred Astaire. Yes, there's a huge age difference between the two in this film but the romance between them was not totally unbelievable. It just wasn't very inspiring. And the entire movie wasn't very interesting or fun to watch.	2.0	0
med_183578	Sad and a bit of a mystery somInwontbgivebitvaway, but it is not a comedy as billed and the acting is iffy. The script is not very tight or well done., a lot is left unexplained and remains misplaced.	2.0	0
med_183579	This was a hard movie to watch, the director clearly was making a statement trying to equate the rise of Christianity with the current rise of Islam in the setting of ancient Egypt.

med_183586	This is my favorite light day workout from Ellen. This works well for me after 3-4 days of hard workouts.

med_183728	Good movie as we have seen it multiple times before. However, the digital download did not work at all - I'm not sure if it was just the device we were using or what - this was a complete waste of money, as we only got about 5 minutes of the movie before there was some time of technical error and it shut off and wouldn't allow us to replay - very frustrating.	1.0	0
med_183729	A feast of pure terror, this film takes the viewer along on a wild roller-coaster ride through the malefic haunting of a young woman, recently bereaved, who makes the mistake of posing as a (fraudulent) spirit medium - and ultimately becomes one for real, with disastrous results. This film has more than a slight Lovecraftian tinge! It clearly states that to invite the Unknown in can be a lethal mistake. Very good for a low-budget film.	4.0	1

med_183748	"Piling on the reasons for making this an ""R"" rated film at the very beginning turned me, and my 18-year old son, off before we'd watch 10 minutes.

The rest of the cast was superb too. The second series was great drama, but just a tad less great than last season. There is no other show quite like it. In any event, it's great entertainment and I'm sure going to miss it.	5.0	1
med_183785	This children's movie is slightly easier for a parent to endure than a lot of disney movies. It boggles the mind how many people over the age of twelve are devoted to it.

med_183788	Wow, I did not know what to expect from this movie, but it was amazing. I was so moved by this movie. What a world they created. The lead character never speaks yet is so powerful. The lead actress says three words. So incredibly moving.	5.0	1

med_183913	We got this because my son is a big fan of Percy Jackson book series. Beside Uma Thurman's performance as Medusa, there's not much to this movie for the boys. On the other hand, tween girls will be in heaven. I'm pretty sure this is the target audience sadly.	2.0	0

med_183936	I read the book before I saw the movie. I can't believe it could be so different. They killed off Rhonda Dawe instead of Anne Meridith and made Dr. Roberts gay. Next time I hope they read the book before they make the movie. The only good thing in it was Mrs. Oliver.	2.0	0

med_183961	Was hoping with the RZA and Tarantino's backing, not to mention a few great action/genre stars that this would be great. What it actually is is stilted, nonsensical and actually pretty boring. About the only good fight scenes in the film are the Gemini and Liu's, which was unfortunately too short. I wonder who the fight choreographer was because especially during the start of the film everyone looks like they're floating and the action is both slow and ineffectual.	2.0	0

med_183982	Love the anime! It is very entertaining and I love the plot. The only problem I have with this product is that the case is very poorly created. There is no way all four disks are held safely in this case. I received all four disks scratched up and so I had to pay to fix them. The case doesn't hold the CDs well at all!!!! Which really pisses me off, but I absolutely love this anime. This anime is fantastic!	4.0	1
med_183984	"My husband and I watch this DVD on regular basis... it is hilarious. I'm so glad that I gave Kevin Hart another chance. I had written him off after ""Soul Plane."" He has really grown as a comedian and is better than ever. I <3 Kevin Hart."	5.0	1
med_183985	I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. Some mixed elements of Asian and western film made a moderately tense movie. The jump scares are fairly predictable but that does not take away from the value and creepiness. Pacing could be better, some secondary story arcs were resolved to fast or less than satisfactory. Overall worth viewing with others and better than many offerings in this genre.	4.0	1
med_183986	It was a great story. You felt the emotions of each character. Mr. Sarkar's second movie is a hit . Waiting for more.	5.0	1

med_183989	I really like Alex Pardee's art and was really excited to see this project. The idea for the story is really good, but there's little payoff in the film. It needed more interactions with the monsters, and it just kinda ends before anything really great happens.	2.0	0

med_183994	If you are reading this review to sort out if you might want to rent this or buy it - this may help: DON'T!!! It is not scary, nor is it (intentionally) funny.

med_183996	Christian as usual is phenomenal in his acting. I give it 3 stars for him alone.

med_184015	I don't know if it's because this is 12 years old or if I just watch too closely but it seems for a top spy organization they make a lot of blunders. For example, they have triple security on family members and they just walk out or have cell phones to call who ever they want. A one point, one of the bad guys kills 4 or 5 agents then acts intimidated by one security guard.	2.0	0

med_184018	Effective biopic of the late Apple co-founder Steven Jobs. Captures the complicated facets of the man as a human figure, revealing his emotional side.

The director gives us a great beginning with the author, shirtless, bloody and holding a hammer being arrested by the police but then doesn't show us what happened. The author is left alone at the Monte Cristo-we hear the creaks and knocks but we don't know exactly what happens to the author that put him in that bloody shirtless state.	2.0	0

med_184094	I'll be honest, I didn't watch it. I was excited because the seasons said they were free for prime members, but when clicking upon them, they require a purchase. 1 star, not for the content - which I love - but for the misrepresentation by amazon.	1.0	0

med_184100	Do you like movies filled with thrills, edge of the seat excitement, over the top special effects?. Then this is the movie for you........to skip. It's just a few young girls rolling around in the sand pretending to be possessed. That's it. Don't expect anything else.	1.0	0

med_184115	Oh lord, why did I waste my time on this series. I'm a sucker for supernatural and will sit through any bad vampire drama just for that reason, but not sure the Twilight series was worth it. One of those things you have to pull the shades for and watch when no one is home or knows you rented it if you're over 14. Painful. Sorry.	1.0	0
med_184116	overall, a good season. Some great team episodes, some good spotlight episodes for characters, some interesting ongoing storylines. A few episodes where heavy-handed preaching makes you look for Aesop or your local minister trying to hammer the lesson in. The loss of executive producer Jonathan Glassner and the addition of several new writers really shows, however they did seem to try (unlike later seasons). Despite a few bobbles, a solid effort.	4.0	1

med_184118	I searched for this movie for ten years. I was happy to find it here. But the quality of the dvd was awful. Almost half way through it began to freeze and distort.

med_184125	Bad movie, not the worst ever but not good at all. And a total paint by numbers story, with nothing unique or interesting. Vennessa is always nice to look at and I keep expecting her to show us she can really act, but I have yet to see real proof. This is a poorly written and directed movie so I won't hold it against her too much but still, the point is just don't waste your time with this.	2.0	0

med_184141	It's a great show each episode leaves u wanting the next	4.0	1
med_184142	The only reason this is not 1 star is because it had a few actually funny lines and a couple well shot action sequences. Gratuitous violence that does not serve any purpose, parodic or otherwise, poorly acted and poorly directed from a timing standpoint. The story is not engaging and does not move along. Not a worthy tangent.	2.0	0
med_184143	I've bought the Classic Movies, the Comedy set, and the musical set, and they are worth the cost. Stage Door Canteen from the musical set, the sound is a little off, but all in all, worth the cost.	4.0	1
med_184144	The film captured my interest when I was watching it on television. I didn't have time to finish watching, so I rented it. I was not disappointed. The action and mystery kept me watching until the end which was satisfying. I don't watch many movies like this, but this one was well worth my time.	5.0	1
med_184145	Tries to be profound and complicated but the themes are actually very simplistic with feel good protagonists and cartoon like villains. Of course if you don't like it, you must not understand it due to your inferior intellect and lack of cultural enlightenment.	1.0	0

med_184149	Another B rated movie from Asylum films. This one though, no back story, no character development.

med_184158	While the two disc special edition is a good idea, the price is ridiculous and the movie it's not that good. First of all, they edited a lot of stuff from even altered some things, like for example the story of the origins of the wolves, actually in the book it's more longer and exciting.	1.0	0
med_184159	dvd appeared to be in good shape wien it arrived. we played it a few days ago and everything was fine for approx 70% of the movie. it then atarted stopping and blurring and getting out of focus. i played another movie later and had no problem. would like to get a different one if possible.	2.0	0

med_184168	Pictures of the actual item or action words being featured would make this DVD better, but I believe it will serve the purpose of helping my grandson sound out words and that's all I was looking for. The visuals are of a woman moving to the music and doing some charade-like movements to go with the words featured within a box in the upper left corner of the screen.	4.0	1
med_184170	While as an adult I do not notice a difference in this v.s other Sesame Dvd's, for some reason this just isn't one of my toddlers favorite ones to watch.

The acting is pretty bad, no attempt at all made towards credibility (one man ALONE winched an entire busload of children from an underpass to the top of the bridge) or with continuity (wet hair and rain one minute, dry hair and no rain the next).

Ryan isn't afraid to be silly (but in a good way) and shows in the end what a heart of gold she 's got. Visit Paris and the French countryside during this movie and watch the fun begin with the cat and mouse chase between these two stars. You'll laugh and dream at the same time...	5.0	1

med_184212	I wish I could give this a good review. It has the bones of a good film, but is destroyed by really bad acting and archetypal characters. Also the metaphor of the story of Little Red Riding Hood is totally lost. I wouldn't say the ending is predictable, just boring. Could have been much better. I mean no on really cares who the wolf is by the end, just that the movie end soon to put you out of your misery. one star is all this deserves.	1.0	0

This video brings it all home, again. Thanks!!	5.0	1
med_184217	I had really high hopes for this film - great source material, solid cast, etc but it fell far short of what it could have been. The plot ended up being not only hackneyed and obvious but also dreadfully full of holes. It should have been far better than it was.	2.0	0

med_184248	This is a very general overview of Angkor Wat, only goes for 9 mins and is really just a tourist promo. Not a lot of relevant information about the art work or architecture; the visuals are good but unless you are compelled to collect everything about Cambodia, like me, it's not worth it.	2.0	0
med_184249	Lise Lindstrom is wonderful in this production of Turandot. She is playing this role all over the world and you can she why, she is glorious, both vocally and she looks stunning. I would like her to be not quite so stiff on stage and become more of an actress, if she did that, nothing could stop her.	5.0	1
med_184250	A theme constantly reappearing in the movie is the conflict between two identities - the new and old, the indian and american, and past and forward. It somehow was made that development more often than not favors a more regressive one, and this deeply troubles me. For me, a widow returning to a third world country becoming a street-artist is deeply upsetting. She could have done better if she stays, although the director will try to nudge you away from thinking that. Very manipulative.	2.0	0

med_184258	Bought this primarily for Jeff Allen. Have seen him in concert, shook his hand, an inspiration in himself and the power of faith. Did not know the other two but was open to their offering.

med_184264	what a wierd movie! from bad acting to incest i don't know where to begin. the movie is a cross between a bad horror movie and a porno. the director actually manages to keep the viewer in some suspense until about midway through the film then it just gets ridiculous. but if you like cheesy movies you may like this. if you want a real film about cannibalism and an ideology about it watch the movie Ravenous	2.0	0
med_184265	First thing I don't know why Kevin is placed on the front of the movie like he is a main character, when in fact he is a very very small role at the end of the movie. The thing we noticed about this film is it has no real direction or lesson or theme. The acting is pretty bad through most of the movie.

med_184269	This is an interesting and unusual show , well worth a watch,, not like any show or series I have ever seen a slice or old america with mysticism, and an interesting subject matter.

med_184271	This is simply a collection of News reel footage and similar, from the WWII - Korean Conflict era. The type my parents used to see in the movie theaters when they were kids. While some of it is interesting, the title is a bit misleading and it certainly is not worth paying for - it should be included with Amazon Prime.	2.0	0

med_184281	I was very disappointed. I really like most of Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson comedy. I really liked the first Zoolander. I was hoping the bad reviews were wrong or the reviewers did not get the silly type of humor. There were a few funny parts but that was still a mile away from being a decent movie. Sorry, I really wanted to like this movie. Now I feel like warning others that liked the first Zoolander so they don't feel the same disappointment.	1.0	0

med_184295	The movie is definitely old, but I do remember the time it was released and it was a good movie. Watching it now, with the Final Cut, thrown in, it was a little outdated, meaning it no longer had the past impact. Still it is a good movie. Audio a little shaky, Video slightly better. 3.5 Stars.	4.0	1
med_184296	Bittersweet and witty. Great screenplay. As for the double disc --careful: the second disc is only Digital players and CDROM. Contrary to most Spec. Ed 2Disc sets: All the Special Bonus Features are on DISC 1. Should've just gotten the single disc version.	4.0	1

However recent news reports [Feb 16] indicate such an activity was indeed being conducted in Palm Springs, California.

med_184313	Boring... great setup and a bit of confusion but the movie gets more laughably lame. The use of the smoke/fog machine really distracts from the tension that it is supposed to build up. The full on shot of the monster and the illogical gaffs in the story towards the end of the film really nose dives the film.	2.0	0

The jacket and disc cover have clearly been printed with an inkjet printer and there is no way to turn off the Korean subtitles!

med_184325	My favorite movie of all time. It gets 2 stars because the audio is straight garbage and is one of the bigger parts of this movie! The HD BluRay quality is what I expected and great. For a movie that made its mark on a very realistic shootout in the streets of Los Angeles, this re-release either was made in Mexico, or they really don't care about sound quality. Good luck deciphering any dialogue during this 2+ hour film where Oscar-worthy moments happened, but you can't hear the lines.	2.0	0

med_184336	I actually watched this without knowing any of the backstory associated with it. I found it a very good movie...not perfect, but movies are make believe, and I found it very enjoyable. I thought the story was fine, and maybe easier to understand on the second watch, but the characters were good, the actors very good, and I thoroughly enjoyed the locale. Doesn't deserve the bad rap it's getting, IMO. A good rom-com.	4.0	1
med_184337	The Bottom Line: The first half of this made-for-tv movie, which concerns itself with Shackleton back in England, is often slow, but the fine acting of Branagh and the more adventure-packed second half make this a film worth watching for those interested in the man himself or polar expeditions.	4.0	1

med_184346	Very different point of view of when a person goes missing. There's really great acting in this show. I just wish that the story would have spent more time focused on Leann's character and her story and less time for example on the (retiring Detective's party). Good show needed more closure and dragged out a lot of necessary information.	4.0	1
med_184348	Sci-fi b-movie though with good practical special effects, and an enticingly cool premise - but ultimately just another lousy, poorly directed, quagmire plot, sci-fi b-movie. Definitely not worth the rental price of $6.99. Apparently the future is comprised of guys are screaming at each other, half-crazy, and really doing nothing else. Wait for it on Netflix or Amazon Prime. This is one of those movies I regret paying for, especially $7.	2.0	0
med_184349	There really used to be a reality show where folks were sent to different haunted locations and challenged to investigate, and I enjoyed watching them, so I thought this would be right up my alley.

med_184353	"This is a good action movie, albeit difficult to understand some of the dialogue, due to the heavy British accent some of the characters had. However, hearing the ""f-bomb"" after every other word, took much away from what would have otherwise been a great action movie. I did not care for Samuel Jackson's character as a hybrid intellectual with a ""thug"" mentality.

med_184359	Sadly, I was disappointed - hoping this one to be well worth watching and in some parts, there was a certain level of good solid tradition depicted but as for the details in some areas (twists and turns in the story-line which were grossly out of sync with how the real Person of the stories actually responded) - they left much to be desired since these details were fraught with a lack of integrity and cultural authenticity.	2.0	0

Cheryl Hines who plays his wife is such a doll, she is so patient with Larry. The show is totally funny, its really worth binge watching on a weekend! Love this show	5.0	1

med_184443	Last year I stumbled across FDR American Badass with my podcast Zak's Movie show. We then interviewed Ross Patterson himself awesome guy btw. watched his other films and have been a fan ever since! It's a funny film with plenty of laughs he is genius!	5.0	1
med_184444	Should you find yourself strapped to a chair, immobile, without a remote to turn off this movie, then you have no choice. Take your punishment. A story of a crazy jackass just shooting at everyone and everything, even a bird. Totally senseless. That's how the movie depicts that this country is no place for old men. This movie is a waste of time and I refuse to spend any more time writing about it.	2.0	0

med_184452	Very basic moves geared more towards beginners in circuits. If you are used to P90X, ruthless, insanity, Julian Michael's, etc, you will be disappointed and bored. But it is good foundation exercises for those wanting to start a home exercise program. Exercises are not too complicated. I am pretty sure you would have to do all 4 (25 minutes each) workouts to burn 900 calories.	2.0	0
med_184453	This show is great. Top to bottom, the characters, scenery, cinematography make it a pleasurable show. Most of all - the writing. The lines - especially Ian McShane's are epic. Thank you prime for bringing me a series I missed the when it was running.	5.0	1

med_184455	Excellent renditions of a classic film that took undead movies in a new direction at the end of the era of Italian horror .We get to experience firsthand the desolution of our culture run amok in a post apacolyptic zombie infested world where our own demise turns out to be the biggest joke of all. But taken rather seriously as we follow an intrepid band of survivors trying to make sense of a world gone mad.	4.0	1

As a side note this cd is very useful when working with pets.	5.0	1

med_184467	The Last Christmas episode looked like they were really struggling this year to come up with a Christmas story. My kids normally enjoy the doctor who episodes, but after 20 minutes they were ready to move on. This episode was very repetitive, and grew boring quickly. The beginning seemed promising, but it went down hill as the show progressed.	2.0	0
med_184468	This review is based on the condition of the CD itself. I'm sure this is a very good walking exercise CD, however, I had 2 CD's shipped and neither one would play. It seemed that the CD was warped or otherwise damaged. So, I never got to use it as I gave up on having any more shipped to me.	1.0	0

med_184473	I have a hard time connecting to a character like Superman, and this film didn't help. It's visually dazzling, although toward the end it was just too much. I guess watching invincible people inflicting mass human casualties and property damage gets old pretty quickly (and was anyone else profoundly distracted by the huge Sears logo that kept appearing during some of the key fight scenes?)... and I'm still wondering how he managed to find a razor blade strong enough to shave off his beard.	2.0	0

med_184490	Chris Evans, without a doubt, makes this movie. The other characters are fun, and interesting in their own ways, but every scene without Evans is depressing in its absence. The characters play off each other quite well, and it's an exciting and fun romp from start to finish. This movie isn't Citizen Caine, but it's a great popcorn flick to watch on a lazy Sunday.	4.0	1

med_184499	A good rendition of the original book, the film chronicles one of the most extraordinary survival stories of our time. Although it is hard to accurately capture the extreme physical hardships and deprivations endured by the survivors, the actors do a fine job in portraying the bonds of friendship, trust, and dependency that develop under such horrendous conditions.	4.0	1
med_184500	Band of Brothers is the only production that has actually changed the way I live and think. This series is by far the most outstanding thing I've ever seen, period.

I give HBO two thumbs up on this one.	5.0	1

med_184507	Great story, based on the book, based on the real life characters. Given the time period its only natural some scenes and dialogue have been editorialized, some facts, private moments, conversations cant be known, but I think the story line was well researched and the costumes fit the period (with the exception of a visable zipper here and there). Overall I enjoyed it, recommend it and cant wait to see the Red Queen	4.0	1

But when I played it, it was in Spanish, no subtitles, spend hours just to get english out , I do not speak Spanish since I am Chinese american.

Amazon should not sell product with foreign languages (Spanish, russian, swahili) etc without ANY translation, after all we are in the USA. Wasted my money on this one.	1.0	0

med_184520	This was just ok. I purchased it for $5 and was really liking what I saw in the critics. It could be because the animation is dated, that will play a factor.

med_184531	So heavy handed and totally preaching to the choir. It's a shame because the subject matter is so important. We don't need a documentary telling the converted what we already know to be true.

med_184534	I went out of my way to see Damian Lewis, a favorite, only to be sickened by all the blood and violence. Claire Danes character seems to me to be unrelievedly dour and a female trying to be a male, which can only be done by making her a mental case. Ugh	2.0	0

med_184612	Smart show with a likable leading lady. Although it is quite unrealistic at times, Veronica Mars makes for some good teen entertainment. The acting is good and convincing. Definitely worth a try if you enjoy shows like Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Dawson's Creek, or Friday Night Lignts.	5.0	1
med_184613	Wonderfully human story told with a bit of spice around contrasting international cuisines. Despite a plot line that's somewhat contrived, this is a lovely and very entertaining film. Manish Dayal and Charlotte Le Bon star as the young chefs but Helen Mirren and Om Puri truly shine as life-scarred oldsters who learn a thing or two for the good before the credits roll.

med_184614	After reading a great deal of positive reviews for this film, I added it my Blockbuster queue as soon as it had a release date. I had high hopes for the film, and it lived up to them. The special effects were cool, the action was good, the story was intriguing, and the soundtrack was very fitting. It's a good flick. Check it out.	4.0	1
med_184615	If you like British comedy, or if you have never experienced the exquisite nature of the genre, this is a great place to begin. This is right at the top with the best of them. I was the only one in the theatre who screamed with shock, but we both howled with laughter through much of it. This is one to savor.	5.0	1

med_184621	Infinitely witty, clear path to the heart of the ideas. The character development seemed somehow incomplete, maybe cluttered is the word; too many characters with too little time to connect their dots. The storyline seemed ill prepared for screen.

med_184630	The DVD was damaged or incorrecltly manufactured when I received it. Right our of the box, it would stop in mid play and to get it going again you have to skip part of the movies. Since it was a DVD, I assumed that I could not send it back so I ordered a new one and it works fine.	1.0	0

med_184639	I had this at 1 star, but on second thought it was basically you get what you expect from The Rock and an action movie.

I'm sure it would have been a lot more enjoyable to watch on the big screen in the movie theater.	2.0	0

med_184647	A solid film with solid acting from an ensemble of great Hollywood actors. The special effects were not as bad as described from some of the overly picky reviews. The sea battle is at night. I don;t see the difference between scale models and CGI effects. At later the models are real objects. Patricia Neal is terrific in the film as is John Wayne. They made a delightful, mature loving couple; too bad they weren't paired in more films for older audiences.	4.0	1
med_184648	This has to be the most boring movie depicting the end of the world. If it wasn't for incredible cast and the nude scene of Kirsten Dunst in the nude I would have given this movie a 1 Star. Basically, this is a B movie with A actors much like all of Lars von Trier movies. I can not understand why good actors would wasted their time working with him. If you can't see this for free don't waste your money.	2.0	0
med_184650	This film was well acted and an Academy Award winner. I however found it to be a bit disturbing and it was very difficult for me to continue to watch. ALS is a difficult journey and I guess this is why I had some trouble with it. If this is not an issue for you and you can look at it as a story then perhaps you would give it more stars.	2.0	0

med_184654	The international traffic in human beings is a disgrace as is this movie. The script is atrocious, maudlin, and implausible.

If you are looking for a credible story/drama about human trafficking, look elsewhere.	2.0	0

med_184665	This movie was well done. It's clean and not given to classic hollywood trappings. The key is dismissing the need for a well known face or brilliant acting.

A good ""edge of the seat"" murder mystery, for sure!"	4.0	1

med_184690	As a true Hellsing fan, I can say that this is a great buy. I was so happy with volume 3, and I will be watching excitedly for volume 4. Only problem is mature content, don't let younger viewers see without at least feeling comfortable with its content. As any real Hellsing, or just a vampire fanatic would, I apperciate this as a great show of blood, gore and twisted humor.	5.0	1

med_184692	A great basic premise is badly derailed by poor effort to take full advantage of what should be a devastatingly claustrophobic situation. There really is no mood of menace here, no sense of a threat until the final act when it's far to late to care. A jaw-droppingly poor creature design doesn't help.	1.0	0
med_184695	The source material Alpha Video used to make this DVD is the same as the VHS tape that was circulated a few years back. The picture is a little grainy and the original film to video transfer was poorly executed. The transfer camera was not properly aligned and the tops of people's heads are cut off in medium and close-up scenes. I have purchased a couple of beautiful DVDs from Alpha and I was expecting more. The only reason to buy this one is to have a full length version of the film.	2.0	0

med_184730	The Limey is about a man who travels to southern California to investigate the murder of his daughter. I just didn't see why the critics loved this movie.

med_184731	i just found this dvd annoying. The music attempts to evoke the feeling of a young trendy viewer, although the narrator sounds like Robin Leach. Most of the suggestions, boutique and hotel- wise are for tourists with 'beaucoup bucks' to spend, not very practical! This guide shows more of the inside of premises' than the outdoor scenery, and left me feeling empty.

med_184781	The show is fantastic and worth watching. It is perfect for those who like dark humor (organ harvesting being a frequently used example). Well thought out, often times plain silly humor.

med_184791	Another twist to an attack on the White House. This is a good movie but I think Olympus Has Fallen was a better movie. I liked the president (However unlikely) getting involved with his own rescue. From an acting point of view..Jamie Fox was as good as ever, and this was probably a much better effort from Channing Tatum than any of his previous roles. I would have given this movie 3-1/2 stars, not 4, but there are no 1/2 stars.	4.0	1

med_184797	A friend recommended this movie to me, but I can't say the same. The online reviews kind of make it out to be a black comedy like 'Fargo' (did these people even see that movie??). But it's really just a poorly written/directed rip-off of 'Weekend At Bernies'. Turned it off after a half-hour.	1.0	0
med_184798	It was not what I wanted I want the one that was at the movies around christmas	1.0	0
med_184799	This DVD was a little too simple for me. It would be great for a beginner, but not for someone with years of experience doing aerobics.	2.0	0
med_184801	It is a wonderful adventure. What makes it even more interesting is that there is some truth behind the story.	4.0	1
med_184802	This movie is only good for one thing: the trash bin to be recycled. Unnecessary sex and poor acting. Thirty minutes was more than enough. I turned it off. Don`t even buy it for five cents, it`s not worth the cost of postage.	1.0	0
med_184804	I liked the odd frenetic energy of season 1 a lot. Season 2, IMHO, had a creaky start, but it really found a good balance a few episodes in.	4.0	1
med_184805	I received the DVD no problem. I did not get the plans or the e-book. Those are more important than the DVD. If anyone who bought this package before knows how to get these please let me know! I would love to build this greenhouse! Thank you!!	2.0	0
med_184806	Actors did a good job in character roles. Although the plot was somewhat predictable, the dialogue and scenes were realistic and funny to watch. Good, light comedy to watch with spouse on a weekend evening.	4.0	1

med_184812	After I ordered it I realized I could have ordered them separate for less. The movies were good though and were as described.	4.0	1
med_184814	This is a fantastic movei, the reason for the two stars is that this version is not nearly complete. The real film is an hour and a half long, whereas this one is only 52 minutes. Quite disappointing. There should be some sort of acknowledgement that this is an incomplete version. There is a lot missing.	2.0	0

med_184817	This was a good movie, better than I expected. Theven profanity in this movie was no more or less than most movies so I don't know how someone can say it had too much profanity unless they are living on the moon. When D money mother was saying she keep him in church, she was lying, plain and simple. It had nothing to do with Calvin. Smh, what planet these people live on?	5.0	1
med_184818	Interesting concept, acting needed work, nice science fiction the way people travelled. Would have been disappointed if I had paid for it.	2.0	0
med_184819	Liked this a lot. Little different from the norm at this time.	4.0	1
med_184820	The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because it's not really geared towards people who want to learn the moves. Zoe goes through the sets pretty quickly, sometimes leaving me struggling to catch up. Otherwise, it has tons of great information and is a lot for the price.	4.0	1

med_184828	Wildboyz is a fun show and I enjoy watching it on television. However, there is ABSOLUTELY no reason to buy this dvd collection if you subscribe to MTV. The dvd is not uncensored... there's nothing here that you haven't heard or seen on TV. Same old bleeped out words. Same old censored video. Save your money!!!	1.0	0

med_184834	This movie had very little character development, poor visual effects, and a generally shallow plot. Would not recommend to anyone. Just go watch Elysium in the theatre instead.	2.0	0
med_184835	Purchased solely for the 1937 version which is the acknowledged masterpiece - the 1952 version is awful as so many remakes are. I am a huge Ronald Colman fan and he is wonderful in this film; the supporting cast is tremendous as well. Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. nearly steals the film.	5.0	1
med_184836	Good movie, mix of romance and war! .More like a love story.	4.0	1

med_184841	I can't comment on the movie since I have not watched it. But I did purchase this from the Amazon France site since it was not available here last year. No English subtitles on mine. So if you don't speak French, this DVD may not be so great.	2.0	0

med_184843	First of all it is not readily easy to realize that this is part one of two sets. 3 episodes on each disc. Got two disc 2 and after the first played the rest of that dvd was not playable. Took the wind out of my sales and have not continued to watch.	2.0	0
med_184844	Do NOT purchase this yet. The quality is awful, you see better quality when you tapped them on VHS back in the day. It looks like these were on VHS and then transferred. I had to get a replacement sent because the 1st set some discs/episodes did not work. The replacement set i got, DIFFERENT discs and episodes didn't work. Wait for another company to release these on dvds.	1.0	0
med_184845	First half is a total sleeper. Second half speeds up a bit but could not keep my attention. Wish I could say something more positive because I luv sci-fi. Certainly sorry I bought the Blu Ray...next time I'll watch on Amazon Download and save my extra money for a worthwhile show.	2.0	0

med_184868	First off, this DVD was too expensive for its low-budget acting. You have to start from the beginning of the DVD every time you moved on to review one of the 4 sequences on the list (very dumb idea). This is not worth the money at all!!!!	1.0	0

med_184891	This show is horrible as so many others have commented on so I won't elaborate here. After forcing myself to sit through 15 minutes of the first episode I felt compelled to submit a 1 star rating to lower the average stars as much as possible to discourage people from watching such unsubstantiated and unprofessionally presented material.	1.0	0
med_184894	The show is still enjoyable but starting to get long in the tooth. Too many cast changes over the years and the remaining characters are not growing much but staying pretty static. One show is starting to seem like any other. Don't get me wrong, it's still enjoyable to watch but starting to go downhill.	4.0	1
med_184895	First, I did not care for the way the Branch Davidians were referred to as crispy critters, very crude. Next, the director has an ax to grind with anything to do with religion, and that was the biggest turn off for me.	1.0	0

med_184917	"I was disappointed by this ""documentary"" style series. It seemed like a fairly low-budget production as much of the film revolved around a few shots of the same place over and over again with not much in-depth exploration or archeological background. Also, the over-dramatization of very un-interesting little bits of footage was rather droll, especially in the first DVD. In my opinion, it's not worth the time to watch it."	1.0	0

med_184928	The entirety of the movie is based around Tom Hardy on his phone drive his car. If you have seen the movie Phone Booth with Collin Farrell then you have a good comparison. I thought Tom Hardy's acting was spot on as well as the voice actors he was talking to. I would not really call this a thriller though. Nothing really happens throughout the movie. This is a movie about a man who is at his possible lowest point and is doing his best to keep everything together.	4.0	1

med_184954	With the writers strike most TV shows were drastically reduced in the number of episodes produced. I don't think that these affected seasons should be the same price as full completed seasons, it just feels like your getting ripped off.	2.0	0
med_184956	Others have detailed the plot so I'll skip to the viewing part. The original Lady and the Tramp was loved by adults and children. But CGI has moved way beyond this Disney sequel. While kids have an affection for pets, adults will find the story very simplistic. So let the children enjoy this even if its not your cup of tea.	4.0	1
med_184957	This is a drama film from year 1942. It is not about Hal Blaine, Tommy Tedesco, Carole Kaye and the rest of them. Just to let you know, so you won't be disappointed. Actually, I think this is a swindle. The price is high, but the publishing date refers to Tommy Tedesco's film of the same name. There is no data of the publisher or distributor. Here's the original film: http://www.amazon.com/Wrecking-Crew-Richard-Arlen/dp/B002TCRQM2/ref=sr_1_7?s=movies-tv&ie=UTF8&qid=1335991560&sr=1-7	1.0	0
med_184958	What a great surprise. I enjoy Western movies and have always been a fan of Kurt Russel. His sheriff harkened back to his portrayal of Wyatt Earp. Some of the characters were ok, others thrived and stole scenes. The story was a new twist on a classic. Highly recommend this movie.	4.0	1
med_184959	First, I love subtle movies that many others find too slow-moving, like Remains of the Day. This had an amazing cast, but the screenplay was just...lacking. Nothing much happens, and then the last 10 minutes try to get really dramatic. It is just not well-paced, and while I agree this is probably a (fairly) realistic movie in that not much happens, that's not why people go to the movies.	2.0	0

med_184962	I would say this video is not for the beginners. As long as you know the basic yoga poses, this is a great video for you. There is a 1hr or so session and the instructor is nice and comforting. But this video moves too quickly to follow up for beginners. I never got through this video to the end. You will generate a lot of heat. Above all this is a great work out.	4.0	1
med_184963	okay, here is a guy who makes a car that runs on blood. okay stupid plot stupid movie. it doese have some gruesome kils but i've seen better low budget horror films. this movie is okay for a first time director. but it's something i wouldn't buy.	2.0	0
med_184964	In a time when tensions run high and violence--sexual or otherwise--happens on a regular basis, I find it irresponsible to promote manipulative dating practices. It's like we're teaching the next generation to hate themselves and be someone they're not--to earn love. That aside, the story line was somewhat humorous and I found it to be an enjoyable tale. But really--Hollywood--please stop selling out at others' expense.	2.0	0

med_184966	This would maybe be a good story line if it weren't for the actors and cheap props ruining it all. (Except for the whole having coffee with bigfoot thing). My boyfriend said. They probly spent $1000 on it and made millions off it, cuz bigfoot was in the name.	1.0	0
med_184967	The stars in this movie shine brighter than I've ever seen them before and we laughed out loud, uncontrollably at times, throughout the entire movie. This movie is definitely one of Adam Sandler's best. Loved it! We watched it through Amazon's On Demand service, which provided excellent quality.	4.0	1

med_184975	I was rather surprised how gross and frightening this movie was. It was a bizarre journey into what depths people will stoop to for money and the sadistic pleasure some will get from orchestrating this. It did leave you on the edge of you seat and the acting was sensational. It actually made me nauseous in parts so not for everyone.	2.0	0

med_184983	This is not a good movie. I remembered loving it as a child. I hadn't thought about it in many many years and when I did I had to see if I could buy it. I bought it and it was Boring Boring Boring. I really can't believe so many reviews like it.	2.0	0
med_184984	The sound on the second part of this DVD (Our Miss Brooks) is hardly audible and should never have been released in that condition. Turning the volume up as loud as possible the audio on the DVD can still hardly be heard. There are only 4 episodes on this DVD not really making it worth the price of the item. Very disappointing. I am disappointed also in that this item would be sold by anyone being so poorly reproduced.	1.0	0

med_184986	"So good! Definitely a step away from what you would consider a ""typical Christian movie"" because it really highlights the reality of how show business can change you, your priorities, and your motives. In light of that, it is not a movie for little kids! But it is a good film for those who are interested in faith-based movies. It arrived on time and in perfect shape!"	4.0	1

med_185005	"Like pretty much all of ER seasons 1-8, it's a good series with a lot of interesting side stories and characters who merit a lot of discussion.

med_185007	I can't believe anyone who actually saw this movie would give it more than 1 star. The acting and 'plot' were nonexistent, the 'special effects' were almost cartoon-ish and to top it off you only saw a pack of woolly mammoths, 1 sabre-tooth tiger, and big pyramid thingy.. AND THE WOOLLY MAMMOTHS AGAIN! OMG... it was about as 'BLOCKBUSTER' as a Sci-fi channel made for tv movie.	1.0	0
med_185008	Spoiler alert: Harrison Ford as a villain is a rare site and is something to behold. He's such a fine actor who always plays a hero, his turn here is a welcome change that he does very well. Pfeiffer is of course, fabulous as always. This is a thriller no matter how many times I watch it.	5.0	1
med_185009	Quick Story recap: Joe Dirt is a janitor who happens to find himself on a popular radio show sharing his life story. He has been on a quest to find his family since he was a kid and the movie follows his search and hilarious moments of his life. I love this movie. I think David Spade is hilarious as Joe Dirt and loved the Christopher Walken moments. There are some funny movie references and other jokes that never get old to me and I've seen the movie 4 times.	4.0	1
med_185010	I can't believe I had to watch this movie, but I'd paid so I stayed for the whole movie, we hated it and everyone around us said it was worst movie they'd ever seen. Don't waste your time or money on this movie	1.0	0

med_185013	This movie was a disappointment. The background music was too loud and often interfered with the dialogue, so much was lost. The movie lacked a sense of cohesiveness and structure, so I was left wondering what the hoopla was all about.

med_185020	Wilderness action adventure with Liam Neeson. Always appreciate his mix of sophistication and brutality, in this man vs wild he gets to showcase this contrast. A good plot that places you in the action like a slasher movie, you may find yourself second guessing the characters as they take actions to survive and miss-steps along the way. You won't doze off on the couch while watching The Grey!	4.0	1

Other than missing the Universal-International logo at the beginning, this region-free import looks exactly like my DVD-R. Terrible quality, almost unwatchable on a large screen monitor. Probably the worst picture quality of any of my several thousand DVDs/DVD-Rs/Blu-Rays. And that includes a few from Alpha. Way overpriced.	1.0	0
med_185097	The plot was too essoteric; and the storyline was disjointed throufhout. About 30% inro the movie I lost interest in trying to follow the events. As well, the cinematography was worse than a liw-budget TV mini-series.	2.0	0

med_185116	Seth Green and crew have found their stride. The jokes and stories are better than ever, and Robot Chicken is poking fun at some areas that were previously off limits. The scenes with the Avengers had me rolling on the floor, and I don't want to spoil it for you. The first bit was funny, and the second sendoff was hilarious and likely correct. I highly recommend RBC Season 6.	4.0	1

Very little tension in this ""drama"" because you don't care about the characters. Scenes of backwater Florida were good though but not worth having to watch the rest of the movie."	1.0	0

med_185144	This series was just a great, entertaining little sitcom. Very familiar with some of the situations, as I used to work in the broadcast news biz. The show tanked a bit after Phil Hartman died, but I'm not blaming anyone for it. Definitely worth the purchase.	4.0	1
med_185145	I know this the show has received awards and good reviews. That's why I watched it in the first place, but I found the first episode to be boring, predictable and not very funny.

med_185171	This is a nice low budget movie that I listened to the English version which was very poorly done. The english voice overs were uninspired and really took away from the movie. The acting and script was unconvincing. I am not a fan of flash backs and the flash backs here make no sense as it doesn't add anything, except confusion. It appears that the flashbacks might have been added to extend the movie, Maybe was a little short when finished so they injected them.	2.0	0

It doesn't have horrible language or over the top violence, so we don't feel bad letting our daughter watch with us (along the lines of Dr. Who).

med_185289	Guy Pearce held this movie together. As the hero, he is funny in a smartass sort of way. Damsel in distress is annoying. She loses her cuteness factor fairly early into the movie. Bad guys are fairly bad. Government guys are stereotypical. Some of the action scenes were pretty good. I watched it til the end and never felt like turning it off. So, I must have liked it.	4.0	1

med_185297	"This movie is better than the average B film. Definitely more in the thriller genre. As the creepiness develops, the makers do a decent job in implicating the socially awkward uncle instead of the creepy foster child (spoiler intended). While above average for a ""bad"" movie, it was ultimately unsatisfying. There are hints and flashes of something better, but they don't pan out by then end."	2.0	0
med_185298	P.U., these movies are stinkers. Even knowing much of the dialogue is supposed to be tongue-in-cheek, I could barely stand watching. When you spend most of the first movie rolling your eyes, it's a pretty good clue that you shouldn't continue on with 2 and 3. But, for the sake of my 10 y.o., I persevered. During 2, I made mental to-do and grocery lists and halfway through 3, I finally had to get up and do something else for the sake of my sanity.	1.0	0
med_185299	Perhaps it's because I haven't read the work this movie is based on, but I loved it. Of course, I'm a sucker for almost any movie involving Arthurian related legends and magic. I recommend that anyone watch it.	5.0	1

med_185311	Also the cover baffles me. First movie I've seen where the poster features a character who had literally ONE line and was on screen for 5 seconds while another had zero lines and was in about 2 scenes. All this while leaving out the real supporting cast (Sanada Hiroyuki, Shibasaki Ko, and Asano Tadanobu). Don't judge a book by its cover (or a movie by its poster), but in this case, it says a lot.	2.0	0

med_185323	"I've seen Camelot performed a dozen times, including the movie version with Julie Andrews and Robert Goulet. In all of those cases, I was only lukewarm about the ranking of this musical compared to its peers. The Richard Harris performance makes it clear that it takes an actor of Shakespearean skill to make this piece ""work,"" given that there is a great deal more dialog spoken than sung. This is the Camelot ""not to be forgot."""	5.0	1

med_185352	I loved the movie except the unreal parts that seem to plauge martial arts movies. Flying and floating are just not real. It's one thing to be super agile but the fight with IP man on the table to prove his worth against the top Master really took away from the dice star rating this movie could have had. Other than that it is a good movie. Not bases on a true story as in IP man. But still a good movie aver all.	4.0	1

med_185355	Very disappointed in the lack of quality of the DVD picture. It is NOT High Def. I can't speak to the BluRay but the DVD, although in fine physical form, has a slightly blurry picture.

med_185428	I loved this film for a multitude of reasons, not the least of which was the performance by James Preston. He portrayed Dean as a young man torn, abandoned and driven to find his center. The supporting characters were well drawn and imperfect in their abilities to nurture Dean; to help him make his soul complete. The cinematography was wonderful; the style evoked the times. Seen this film twice and wouldn't mind seeing it again.	5.0	1
med_185429	It's an interesting story based on real people. it's about sexual desires of a paralyzed man. It's totally natural from biological point of view. A priest provides consultations to diminish the psychological barrier. What surprises me is that Helen Hunt agreed to do this movie. She always gives me the impression that she is very cautious about nudity and sexual display on screen, but in this movie, she is not only completely nude but also performs intercourse, as a sexual therapist.	4.0	1

med_185435	Five reasons why this collection is the greatest: 1. No commercials! 2. It shows the entire show. Many of the TV stations cut down scenes to make room for commercials.

med_185436	"Despite fast and prompt delivery, the film is way over priced. It was done in 1994 with very bad audio and even corney and inappropriate music that doesn't fit the ""vintage"" scenes.

med_185450	This is a very well made movie, with a young Johnny Depp. It is thoughtful and beautifully filmed. Definitely something top watch after this past election cycle. (2016). The message is timeless.	4.0	1
med_185451	This is what I received in the package. The discs doesn't seem legitimate.	1.0	0

med_185458	Slow overall. Acting stilted, direction without imagination. Not up to Le Claire standards. No anticipation. Not worth the money.	2.0	0
med_185459	If you don't have anything to do, and you can't sleep and you can't go out, and your fingers can't move to play some mindless app, then I recommend this movie. While the acting is great, the story is not. Just when you start to feel the connection with the characters and the plot seems to present itself kindly, the movie ends. This would have been a good story to tell in more than one episode, perhaps not in movie format.	2.0	0
med_185460	This is the most brilliant series!! Viewing it is highly contagious. I can't wait for the next series to become available. I wish they'd make a series on following up on how the investments turned out. You can learn from watching these self made millionaires.	5.0	1
med_185462	These are awful. Alot of them are nothing more than porn flicks.	1.0	0
med_185464	Horribly done. The plot along with the dialogue and the style of just wandering around the caves is just so boring. This makes DARK WATER better by comparison. And I don't mean comparing two good movies. I mean that compared to THE CAVE, DARK WATER is the lesser of two evils.	1.0	0
med_185465	The first movie is fabulous but the other 2 are a waste of time. Paul Walker isn't in them and I don't know why they were even made.	5.0	1

med_185467	No matter how many times I see this, nor how many years since it was made, this story is TIMELESS. The music and the performances are superb, and NO it is NOT RACIST, SEXIST, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera!	5.0	1

med_185473	Love this movie!!! I've been wanting it for about 4 years and now I have it. It's a great story about the Iditarod Dog Sled race in Alaska and all of the problems they faced that year, very educational.	5.0	1
med_185474	totally darker than what you would expect from Kevin Smith, but very entertaining in a completely wrong and awful sort of way. Just the kind of movie I love.	5.0	1
med_185475	This play was good and not cheaply done at all, but Jecaryous usually does it right. It looked more like a movie than a play. I even added this one to my DVD collection.	4.0	1
med_185476	Eureka is escapism, not education or a reality show. Suspend your disbelief for a while, relax and enjoy the unreal. This is just a half a step from kiddy shows, but engaging none the less.	4.0	1
med_185477	We enjoyed this movie. funny, entertaining worth the rental. Not as good as our other Marvel movies but that's Okay. If your looking to be entertained then this is one to watch. Loved the characters. And don't forget to wait till after the credits are done to get another snipit.	4.0	1
med_185478	Funny stuff! Need a laugh than this might just be for you! Watched this when it was on TV and liked it enough to buy the video. Video quality is as you would expect but the humor is still good. Listen close to what they are saying, funny stuff!	4.0	1
med_185479	If you're a fan of the film and don't already own it on bluray, this is worth a purchase. The only additional footage really worth it (in my opinion) is the original ending that this version has. The film's ending makes a lot more sense with this version. Sound and picture are both excellent.	4.0	1
med_185480	Good photography and camera work! Writing was poor and I found the movie to be a great waste of good acting talent from good actors! Although the movie was meant to be a horror flick I personally don't like it when evil rules and the devil wins in the end. Other than that the constant negativity was occasionally well glossed over with some fine nudity. I will be giving my copy away. I probably should burn it!	2.0	0

med_185483	This is the most amazing movie I have ever seen. It is so hard to describe what it is exactly, but the camera work, acting, background story and the actors are inexplicably amazing. I wish the ending was a bit more explicit (clear). They didn't even get to kiss. I saw the Hulu version so I might have missed some parts. Hulu cuts parts off (rip off). Nevertheless, it is right their next to Heavenly Creatures and other lesbian classics. Definitely recommended.	5.0	1
med_185486	Clint Eastwood plays his usual curmudgeon role, but he's so good at it! Amy Adams is perfect in the role of his daughter. Just a very nice story to sit back and enjoy.	4.0	1

med_185488	Excellent acting and good presentation of history from an atypical viewpoint.	4.0	1
med_185489	This movie is hilarious! A movie about a fish-tank cleaner that suddenly gets thrown off course and must become a gigolo to pay back some money. Anyone with a sense of humor that doesn't become offended too easily will enjoy this movie.	4.0	1
med_185490	What an overrated movie! I can't believe the wasted amount of time I spent watching this ridiculous film. The actors were not believable in their parts and no attempts at any correct science was involved.	2.0	0

med_185498	Technically, it's just one clich after another. Historically, this movie is nothing but a shameful reflection of how much some of today's Taiwanese appreciate their great grandparents' Japanese masters during the Japanese occupation of Taiwan between 1895 and 1945. As a Taiwanese, I'm totally disgusted!!	1.0	0
med_185499	Remembered this movie from when I was in junior high school. Couldn't resist seeing if it was still as funny as my memoriy was of it. It passed! Some are not as funny as I remembered but overall it still regularly brings a guilty laugh. We were weird back then to say the least.	4.0	1

med_185544	If it had been a spoof on previous Godzilla movies, it would be worth two more stars. Pity. The monster and special effects would've got laughed out of the theater two or three decades ago. And, a laugh you'll get out of the completely banal dialogue. Some of it is so bad it's hilarious. The acting would embarrass a community theater.	1.0	0
med_185545	The first two seasons were awesome. This one was a waste of time and money. The show seemed forced, too much focus on CGI and not enough on plot, and the adult scenes were pointless. My husband didn't even want to finish watching it. I only saw the whole thing because I couldn't sleep one night. It was that bad. In my opinion skip it, leave the memory of the good Spartacus intact.	1.0	0

med_185558	Not being a fan of rap or Eminem, I was hesitant to see this movie, but I did on the recommendation of a friend. I was not disappointed, as a different side of Eminem emerged. His acting, along with Mekhi Phifer's acting, impressed me very much. Their relationship throughout the movie transcends the difficulties they both encounter, culminating in a restoration of their friendship when it is most needed by both of them toward the end of the movie. 8 Mile is definitely worth watching.	4.0	1

It's the kind of original horror movie that they haven't made since films such as In the Mouth of Madness and Lord of Illusions. Plus the end is gutsy, left me pale and speechless, it's both disturbing yet it has some dark humor to it too. This is a creepy film, almost creepier than the director's backround, lol.	4.0	1

med_185584	I happen to like this show a lot. However doing the math, 22min per episode x 5 episodes = 110 min. This volume is over priced. 5 episodes is too few for 13.49. I hope this series will eventually air in Season Box Sets. Until then, I would suggest recording the series as it airs old and new episodes on TV.	2.0	0

med_185591	I am a big Duke fan, but these movies missed the mark big time. They are missing the good old down home feel and the series had. They try to put new characters in, which is always a mistake. People want to see the original cast only. The Dukes reunion was okay, but not great. I miss seeing Daisy in her shorts. The hollywood one is a very forgetful and why did they bother to make it movie.	2.0	0
med_185592	It is a golden age for fans of Dinosaurs. Computer animation has brought these ancient beasts to life.

med_185622	It was interesting insight into a figure I did not know how he accomplished his goals. He also had to struggle to get where he was and showed what perseverance can do.	4.0	1
med_185623	Loved the books but the movie was extremely boring. It was all I could do to sit through it. The 1980's BBC TV series was WAAY better even though it did not have the special effects the movie did. All characters in that series really fit the part and did a much better job. The Zaphod in the movie was terrible, as was Marvin, Arthur, and just about everyone else. Don't waste your money.	1.0	0

med_185634	This movie is based on a silly plot about ramen which could have been written by any 13 year old boy. Lots of meaningless and boring scenes about people who never become a part of the overall storyline. Random sequences of trite and pointless food discussions abound. Only very eccentric and oddball characters truly seem to like this movie, otherwise this is probably... not for you. If you are looking for funny, humorous, light-hearted, personality-driven characters, stick to Mel Brooks and Adam Sandler. You'll definitely be happier.	1.0	0

med_185657	I was extremely disappointed that this movie did not live up to its preview. Why even bother have actors portray the royal family when they were merely bit players in the plot. I was under the assumption this movie was about their visit with FDR at his Hyde Park estate and not a story about how much of a perv FDR was. Classic bait and switch plot.	2.0	0

If you are expecting hilarity as was in the second movie with the baby drinking vodka, etc. you will be sorely disappointed.

med_185708	This movie, though it's no longer my favorite, is kind of a classic in my world. I saw it in the theatre, loved it, and bought it as soon as it was affordable. It's got great lines, some aimed at adults and some at the general audience. There isn't too much focus on the skating or on the interpersonal relationships; a really nice balance exists between the worlds on and off the ice.	4.0	1

Glad I saw both seasons, although the ending isn't a ""happily ever after"" one."	4.0	1
med_185729	Just as Daniel Craig and the writing crew are bringing a welcome change to the James Bond story, Christian Bale does it for Batman.

If you've shied away from Batman after the last few in the series, you will definitely climb back on board with this movie.	4.0	1

I don't think a different co-star would have mattered, though, since the script is lame and contrived. A career stepdown for Ferrell.	2.0	0

med_185804	"Not good for sheeple who can't handle the truth. I find it impossible how any logical, objective-minded person cannot take this evidence at face value and question the ""official story"" of that horrible event. The fact that we even have to have an ""official story"" vs any other variation of what actually happened should raise a red flag. If you can't handle the truth don't watch this! Go back to watching football or reading Justin Beiber and Miley Cyrus articles."	5.0	1
med_185805	Thought that I was going to see a biography about Hector Lavoe and the origins of Salsa. Instead you get 99% of the screen time devoted to Lavoe's wife (who cares) and the atrocious bad acting of Jennifer Lopez. The only good thing is Anthony's singing but he never completes a song as Ms Lopez took all the screen time.	1.0	0

Lovely ""eye candy""; the music would be fun if one could actually listen to it while ""dancing""; however, Hemalayaa chatters incessantly through it. It was difficult to get our heart-rates up, and there was a lot of ""down time"" doing the hip shimmy, which could have been utilized illustrating other dance steps. It was fun the first time we tried it, but we haven't used it since."	2.0	0
med_185817	I would give this -5! Worst waste of time ever! If you're into cry baby couples going on a camping trip and having no answers for whatever the hell happens to them then this is your movie. DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE! IM SERIOUS IT SUCKS MORE THEN THE SUCKEST THING YOU'VE EVER SEEN!	1.0	0

med_185833	The movie by itself is good, but the historical context of the film is not credible. The prisoners all appear well fed. The prisoners produce a slew of rifles at the end, driving off thousands of SS troups. I think the Communists and East Germans didn't want to show a picture that created a negative picture of forced labor camps or the secret police, as they had their own.	2.0	0

med_185857	"A boring, mediocre ""thriller"", with unengaging characters, and an illogical plot. By the time you've reached the end, you really have to wonder why anybody is doing what they're doing.

If you want Hitchcokian thrillers, go with the originals (or even Branagh's ""Dead Again"", a much better thriller)."	2.0	0

The fact that he did this in spite of the socialist Mexican government prohibiting any public worship, laity dressing in their attire and persecuting people of faith.

med_186010	LA VOCE DELLA LUNA is Fellini's last film and alledgely his worst one. That's surely due to the presence of the obnoxious Mr. Roberto Benigni who can damage anything he touches. Fellini is in my opinion the greatest film maker of all-time and his work is practically composed only of masterpieces, among them the greatest film ever made, OTTO E MEZZO (EIGHT AND A HALF).

med_186040	Where to begin? Hands down the scariest movie I have seen in years and will without question be taking it's rightful place alongside the other horror films in my collection as soon as it's released out on DVD in a couple days. Like some of the other posters have already pointed out, this is an excellent documentary and a definite recommend to anyone who'd like to know a little more about the fanatical, potentially election-swaying Evangelicals that compromise 25% of the Christian denomination in this country.

med_186059	After all the hype and five star reviews I finally watched this movie, and all I can say is that this is just a mediocre stab at filmmaking. There is nothing special about it. The plot is plain. The characters are boderline annoying. There a few good moments sprinkled thourghout, but they're too few and far between to redeem this pretensious film. Paul Giamatti's character has actually made me hate wine. See this movie if you must, but rent it first.	2.0	0

med_186117	In all the English speaking world, I can't think of a young actress less suited to play Fanny Price than Billie Piper. Why do so many film directors think that Jane Austen needs to be changed for contemporary audiences?

The problem was that the subtitles did not work at all, which made it difficult to understand, and thus frustrating! Maybe the DVD I bought was the only defectious one, who knows. Second, I was disappointed because of the content. I expected a more in-depth analysis of the side effects of globalization. I give it 2 stars only because of the activism behind the movie.	2.0	0

med_186149	I kind of expected this horror/drama film to scare me but alas it did not but what it did do is provide an interesting theory which is the basis for this film: the concept of allowing all laws to be mute for a period of time one night in America. In reality, this type of event would be utterly devastating. While this film is not able to capture that catastrophic result, it does provide a glimpse into a concept I hope is never embraced in our great nation.	4.0	1

She really depends on her looks to get her by in most movies. And she is pretty so I understand. Seemed like an awful lot of this movie was ""borrowed"" from Alien.

med_186204	This series is decidedly unfunny. If there are any actual writers on this show, they can't be more than 12 years old. The utter lack of humor makes this almost painful to witness. The lead character is an awful human being, and if I were to care enough about wanting anything for him, it would be for him to get run over by a semi-truck or to drown. One doesn't watch this show, one endures it. I can envision Trump liking this show.	1.0	0

med_186207	This is not about the film it's about the DVD quality. Subject: DVD of Le Grand Chemin from Editions Montparnasse The colors are excellent and the sound has been remastered. But it is not widescreen (1.77). The aspect ratio has been chopped down to 1.33 (4x3), diminishing the effect of the films most dramatic scene. And there are no subtitles, not even French. So there is still something to be said for the laser disc issued by image in 1988.	2.0	0

Clearly, they used only a very small cast to save money; I can't rememeber the halls of B5 being so empty, even the ship arrival area. And the plotlines of the two stories are, at best, nonsensical (I can't say more without spoilers). Belongs right down there, below ""The Legend of the Rangers""."	2.0	0

I'm now forced to see if I can find my 'VHS' tape from the early 90's, and see if the VCR still works/connects to the TV.	1.0	0

med_186318	Though the DVD was labeled correctly, it turned out to be the wrong show; showing some kind of workout with a ball rather than resistance bands. I would have returned the DVD if I had had time to repackage it and run to the post office. As it was, I just chunked it.	1.0	0

med_186322	"This movie makes GLITTER starring Mariah Carey look Oscar worthy! Lohan is so bad that words can not even begin to describe her performance. The arrangement of scenes makes her acting even worse. The movie is distorted and thrown together. This was a failed attempt at making a ""surreal"" pyschological thriller. Rent at your own risk! Oh, and the stip scenes are....lame!"	1.0	0

med_186327	Not much in the book, a few recipes and a little dialog. Redundant to the TV series. CD,s were good but Mario and group seemed to miss the whole Spanish mentality which is eating as a social occasion and shouldn't be rushed.

med_186338	I think that naploean dynomite is the lowest form of comedy today. All it is is this looser who knows he is and says some dumb lines, and every one thinks this movie is good. Did i loose the point of the movie some where, or is this just stupid. when i saw it i thaught it was dumb to begin with. Whithin the first ten minutes i was about to go to sleep. So I give it a 1 out of 5 stars. ~Goldpetal	1.0	0
med_186339	When Blair Witch became a hit, even though it was NOT even scary, a series of movies popped out like it in third party camera crap where someone is filming everything no matter what.

med_186345	Go into it with no expectation to be 'scared' and you will enjoy it for the campy laughs it is intended for. Overall a likeable cast of characters doing the best with a limited budget. All play it for laughs well. Unfortunately the ending tone doesn't lend itself to all of the comedy that proceeds it. Perhaps they'll raise the funds for the sequel alluded to after the credits. I'd watch it .....	4.0	1

med_186351	I thought with the director and cast that this movie might be worth viewing so I rented it. WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY! If there is a plot it is miniscule. The cast must have had overdue mortgage payments to agree to be in this abomination. One sees more useless scenes of the Hollywood sign; Hollywood landmarks and CA traffic than anything else. Do Not waste time by viewing the film. If someone offers it to you for free, refuse.	1.0	0

med_186362	I have read all of the Outlander books, so I was aware that Diana Gabaldon likes to include sexuality, but I find the overly graphic sex scenes (I don't see how they are any different from pornography) and frankly gratuitous nudity ruins a perfectly good story line. There must be a market for this or the producers wouldn't do it, but isn't anyone else insulted that we are all considered so low-minded and base?	2.0	0

The Ultraviolet codes don't work on the web site for redemption in the US but with a little extra effort, emailing with Flixster/Warner Brothers customer support (uvsupport@warnerbros.com) to prove you own the set, they will add it to your flixster account (make sure you have a flixster account even if you primarily use another UV vendor like Vudu).	5.0	1

Going to replace this with the Blu-Ray version in the future!	1.0	0
med_186379	I liked the first three (the original and two modern) but not this one. The lead actress is not attractive and being sullen and vindictive the whole movie just makes her more so. I don't know why American movie women are so severe looking with bony boy like figures.	2.0	0

med_186385	I did not find this video suitable for beginners. There was NO introduction to the dance steps at all. The instructor goes way too fast and assumes you already know the steps. The music is ok, but I really wish she would TEACH the dance steps before jumping right into the routine.	1.0	0
med_186387	We were expecting a movie, but instead this is a documentary. I didn't like it which is why I gave it two stars. However, I probably should have read the description (which I did not).

med_186392	I really enjoyed this movie, especially because my views on love kind of align with Wallace's (Chantry jokes that she can't tell if he's a complete cynic or a hopeless romantic). The witty banter and chemistry between the characters is why I enjoyed the movie so completely. *spoiler alert* Four out of five stars because there was so much build-up that was great but the ending felt a little anticlimactic and rushed	4.0	1
med_186394	"I was really looking forward to all 3 hobbit movies, but after the first they decided to head down hill. This movie was disappointing in the fact that all they wanted was a huge battle scene that jumped around every where.

I guess you can only ask so much on one book stretched over 3 movies."	2.0	0

med_186413	Dumb fun. MINDLESS VIOLENCE AND Some FUNNY Low BROW repartee. This is akin to Abbot and Costello with impossible characters in improbable situations pulling off superhero feats with marshal arts that do not exist. Foul language is gratuitous and grating.

The scenery was nice because they filmed in locations that were real and held a natural appeal ... castle ruins and ocean cliffs.

Definitely NOT worth watching twice.	2.0	0

med_186418	"I'm sorry to say that I didn't enjoy the movie, though I watched it to the end anyway. It wasn't just that the science seemed implausible.

Plenty of action, just tried a little too hard.	2.0	0
med_186433	"The movie runs along the same theme as Independence Day, except it takes place in a studio city called ""Los Angeles. We don't have much character building before the aliens invade. These aliens appear to be based on early sketches of Star Wars contraptions. The real downside is that these super aliens use conventional weapons; no lasers or special bombs. The movie is mostly gun play. It would have made for a great video game, but as movie it was not worth the view."	1.0	0
med_186434	David Schwimmer- Worst TV star of all time. Matt LeBlanc- Okay since he's playing himself.

When there is supposed to be historical basis to the story, however incidental, some nexus and grounding in the facts is required. Nothing of the kind exists in Django.

I admit I am in my early 50's and have always been an old soul, but you really should see this movie! HATS OFF tot he director, cast and writers, great job!	5.0	1

med_186477	Not happy... Played through my computer, the dvd will not play full screen and played on my dvd player attached to the HD tv, there is a terrible background hiss we determined was not due to the tv or dvd player. (Other dvds play fine) The ad gives you the impressioin there is more concert footage in this. It is not and what there is could only be described as mildly interesting. Don't waste your money on this one.	1.0	0

med_186479	Okay, I'm an old lady who loves Disney movies. This is an enjoyable flight of fancy into time travel with a lot of fun special effects and a good moral at the end of the story. If you're a fan of the teen-Disney movies, you'll love it. You might want to rent it once if you haven't seen it before, but I think you'll buy it just for fun. Add a star if you're a Jason Dolley fan.	4.0	1

med_186483	This is a Canadian show filmed in the beautiful mountains of Alberta. It's about a teenage girl who is a talented horse whisperer. Lots of family drama and growing pains. Well worth it if you've never seen or heard of it. It's definitely something you could watch with your parents or your kids.	4.0	1

med_186492	A pretty good spy thriller with an interesting twist to possibly continue the Bourne theme of a government agency gone wacko now creating a new type of super spy. My only quibble is that the plot gets hijacked in favor of much too long car chase themes. Good Camera work/editing for the chase scenes.	4.0	1

med_186498	This was a very well done film with good acting by all the actors. The subject matter was hard to watch at times given that I presume it was true to fact about the POWs in World war II. Liberties were probably taken in the telling of the story, but the drama and seriousness of the situations therein were well done. I enjoyed watching this movie.	4.0	1

med_186500	This review is for people who are wondering about the HD quality. It's amazing, I was pleasantly surprised. The pilot episode, which I remember being subpar on DVD, is perfect. The detail is amazing, and looks like a current HD broadcast. Very happy that Fox took the time to make sure it would stand the test of time. Looking forward too seeing all 200+ episodes again.	5.0	1

med_186504	Fitzgerald just seemed really selfish and deluded to me. I could not root for him. He talks about his childhood and his two fathers, etc., etc., yet he goes off to go on a golf tour in Europe leaving his pregnant wife and daughter at home. Robert Redford's comments about Fitzgerald starting his own film festival is very telling... the guy can't deal with rejection.	2.0	0

med_186509	This is from Disney Jr. Doc McMuffins is popular with young children. It also teaches kindness to animals when Doc McMuffins takes such good doctor care for her toy animals and dolls.

I also like to support Jessica because she has a lot of free workout videos on her channel and she is a great instructor. Positive but not annoying.	5.0	1
med_186514	It's nowhere near as rich, thematically or visually, as we've come to expect from animation. I've seen Toy Story maybe 15 times; I don't know if I'd watch this again, unless my children really demanded it.	2.0	0

med_186535	I expected 90 mindless minutes of OK comedic action but it was actually much better than that.

med_186545	This was just another great nostalgia trip! Considering the time that lapsed between their musical origins and successes, and the time the concert was performed, the Everly Brothers were almost as dynamic as when they began. The vocal quality was very surprising, and they stayed within their contemporary ranges to maintain their legendary harmony. This DVD was well worh waiting for, and some numbers raised goose-bumps.	5.0	1

med_186549	This trend started in Book 3, but it really made itself known here. Korra is sidelined in a show where she's the title character. And then they pair her with a character who had even less of an arc then she did (but representation, I guess). I watched this show for Korra, not ATLA throwbacks and their offspring.	1.0	0

med_186565	Ok, so I have to admit it was not what I expected. But it was just too delightful to care. It is happy and fun and perky and colorful and the acting is good and so is the artwork. It has lots and lots of sex, so if that is what you want, then this is good. They are not all raping each other. One woman has huge boobs and when her boobs move, they have sound affects, lol. I would buy this again.	5.0	1
med_186566	If you want something to put on and enjoy great film. If you want a full proof movie with great story; be careful. The story is a good one. Very good.

med_186567	The show is alright, but not as exciting as I expected.	4.0	1
med_186568	"I thought it would be good with Tom Hanks in it. But it is rated R and in this case the R stands for ""ruined"".

I am surprised that Tom Hanks agreed to be part of it."	1.0	0

I am very disappointed with this product.	2.0	0
med_186571	Despite some unfavorable reviews here on Amazon, I decided to give this movie a try. I found it sweet, unexpected and fun.

Those of you who liked this film, go watch Franco Zeffirelli's La Boheme, you'll change your mind."	2.0	0

I got the feeling the plot was developed with a Magic 8 Ball. What happens next? Ask the question, shake the ball and look at the answer. In this case, I stopped caring what happened next. The nudity is not full frontal but the sex scenes are explicit enough to make me uncomfortable seeing them with my grown daughter in the room.	1.0	0

med_186646	"purchase was fine - arrived by date promised and the product arrived in the condition described. The reason for the low score is that the DVD was very poor quality - like playing a VHS tape on my 4K TV. My first thought was that someone made this DVD by using a video recorder on a television playing a VHS tape. It's probably not that - it's probably just VHS quality on a DVD. Probably looks fine on a much smaller TV - on 75"" it's nearly unwatchable."	2.0	0
med_186647	Not a review, just wanting to know when this will be USA Region 1 DVD. Have all the past sets, and will be looking for to this series 4. Putting this out as NON-USA is a tease to all of us who enjoy this series.	1.0	0

med_186649	The great thing about The Flintstones DVD is there is no senseless violence, just innocent, imaginative fun. We have found that many movies rated G are NOT appropriate for toddlers the age of my grandson, who is three. He knew everyone's name after watching it once and naturally loves Dino!	5.0	1

med_186653	It is a feel-good movie for your whole family and very funny. I could enjoy more if they made it shorter by cutting some songs and dances. The songs and dances routines are really corny and strangely choreographed. The main character Bhuvan played by Armir Khan looks too handsome and princely for the role. But still I could not help cheering for those poor farmers, a bunch of very funny characters.	4.0	1

Selena Gomez should stick to kiddy flicks and being Beiber's girl -- she definitely doesn't fit in with the Hollywood bad girl crowd. It's also an adolescent's dream film, loaded with nudity, sex, drugs and violence. I give it a 1 star rating only because it's the lowest selection.	1.0	0

med_186740	The movie was a bit slow going with no real action scenes that I have come to expect from the Bourne Series. Since I enjoyed the first three I thought this would be of the same caliber.

med_186808	This just wasn't a good three-quel. It is much slower than the previous two Berserk movies. Lots of emotional speeches. I can't believe I'm saying this, but two unnecessary sexual encounters as they did nothing to move the plot forward. Lots of unresolved character and plot buildup. Main characters were emotionally vulnerable and therefore physically compromised for most of the movie. In the end, nothing special happens except a hint at a sequel.

med_186820	Its does sound good, 3 DVDs for the price of 1, but they are only 50 minutes long each, and none of them have a really good match on them, there all barely above average. But I suppose this is understandable as they were rookies and all. Get it if you really really like the specified wrestlers (Foley, jarrett and Austin) otherwise I wouldn't bother.	2.0	0

med_186828	This is probably the most famous--or rather infamous, depending on how you look at it--offering from the Cannon sludge factory.

med_186838	This was a most enjoyable film. My husband and I sat spell-bound completely through it. Excellent acting and beautiful scenery. We will watch it over and over again. Being elderly, and with health problems, we don't go out to movies or other entertainment. This blu-ray film was just what a relaxed evening called for.	5.0	1

med_186854	"From my review of ""set two"". This set of movies/TV shows was a perfect example of ""bad"" melodrama from the 1970s. The acting is, at best adequate, the plots ""so-so"", the musical accompaniment overdone, and the episodes were at best boring and overly drawn out. All in all an unfortunate purchase"	2.0	0

med_186861	First off I love Star Wars. Always have and always will. When my last vcr took a dump I decided to go to new age and get blue ray dvd. I bought this set and every disc I have to eject and reinsert multiple times for the player to read the discs. Once they do read the movies play just fine with no issues. I guess that is what you get for cheap bundles.	2.0	0

med_186864	Image quality is OK. It has to suffer when you cram so much info on one disc. The best picture of the bunch is Escourt West. The Way West is an embarrassment. Chato's Land is what you'd expect from director Michael Winner.	2.0	0
med_186865	Dragon ball is a great series. I love the series as a whole. my only problem is that none of the boxed sets I have ordered have had the booklet that is supposed to be with it and im up to season 4 now. All that is included is a funimation postcard and the discs. pretty disappointed in that. I'm not sure if funimation just stopped including them or what the deal is. If you want the booklets tho, you may be better of buying it used,	4.0	1
med_186866	Tiered old jokes. Got through about 30 minutes and couldn't take any more. Reminded me of an old high school production where the cast hesitated expecting the audience to laugh. And the audi nice didn't. Awkward.	2.0	0

Well you put an add in all the swingers magazines, try to hook your wife, and then kill her clients. And these are the moral people in the story. This is one incredbley strange but funny story about love, killing, swingers, locksmiths, wine, women, and how to serve people.	4.0	1
med_186871	I like Matthew McConaughey; however, I hate the trashy language especially from a performer who doesn't have to lower his personal standards to be able to work. Usually (and this film was no different) he's more than just a pretty face!	4.0	1
med_186872	"I saw the TV special about Jeff Dunham and thought it was hilarious. Bought ""Spark of Insanity"" and that is a dvd I would recommend but this Christmas special was not that funny. There were a few parts with Walter and Achmed the dead terrorist that were somewhat funny but most of the other parts of the program were dull and I didn't appreciate the sexual content of some of the performance. I wish I had my money back."	2.0	0

med_186877	"When you put Burt Reynolds and Ray Liotta in a movie about 12th Century ""England"" or where at least half the cast is sporting an English accent, trouble awaits. I personally really like Burt and Ray, but I have a hard time picturing Burt as a fur-covered king as much as I have problems picturing Ray as an evil wizard. Jason Stratham does a fair job with a long-winded story and mediocre special effects. But it's the New Yawk accents that put the real nail into the coffin."	2.0	0
med_186879	Ist season is very good at starting and estting up the relationships and drama of this medical drama series. The writting is off the chart and the action and medical drama are superb.

med_186895	My son absolutely adores Little People and watches them constantly. The dvds promote good values and friendship which with todays other shows is refreshing. The Dvd is a total of 10 stories which are broken into two 5 min menus so if want you don't have to play all of them. If you want a product your child will love get this and other Little People movies. It is just unfourtunate that they do not sell in stores. At least none I have been to.	4.0	1
med_186896	This film was incredibly powerful. As a child of the '80s, I only vaguely remember the story of Ryan White. This showed a whole other side to the AIDS crisis at its inception. It is was an incredibly powerful and sad film.	5.0	1
med_186897	I am a HUGE Resident Evil fan but these movies are getting worse and worse. I cant believe someone produced this piece of garbage. Half way through I was so bored. The story is lame and hardly plausible even by zombie standards. No cool weapons or fights, no sex, no fear. Even if I was 13 I would think this movie sucked. It deserves zero stars for this abortion of a movie.	1.0	0
med_186898	I think our expectations were a little too high after First Contact. If you view this movie from the perspective of being a good Star Trek episode, you won't be disappointed. The action certainly isn't as intense as its predecessor, but the story is engaging with a slight twist. If you're a Star Trek fan, it's a must see (or have). Even if you're not, it's a worthwhile rental.	4.0	1

med_186912	The Painted Lady is a marvelous movie in which Helen Mirren delivers a ferocious performance as a former blues singer in search of the killers of her landlord. Her portrayal alone, which spans the spectrum of human emotion from roaring rage to wounded pain deserves an Emmy. The plot at times get a little murky, but stick with Mirren everytime and she'll show you what is still good about television.	4.0	1

med_186918	If you are looking for an action movie that accomplishes an impossible task, then this movie is just what you need. Guy Pearce delivers an irrevant character with cheeky dialogue all the while taking on an off planet prison filled with 500 inmates. What could be more believable!!! This movie was made to entertain and it does just that. So if you want to see a movie where you don't have to think to much about the plot and see a lot of action, then I would recommend Lockout.	5.0	1

med_186921	It is an excellent movie and Clint Easteood and Morgan Freeman have the guts to go against the politically correct b.s. that plagues our society. This shows you how forgiveness, reconciliation, and moving forward help bring countries together and unite countries. We all as humans(regardless of ANY race or color, and yes that includes white) need to come together. Thanks Clint Eastwood and thanks to the 1995 South African Springboks rugby team.	5.0	1
med_186922	For what should have been a clear, pristine Blu-ray, this version was no better than a common DVD. But worse than that, it had one of the worst soundtracks in recent memory. The words were garbled and the the soundtrack was out of sync. And why do inferior production companies have to leave off closed captions? The older the movie, the more likely the audience requires that addition. As to the movie itself....never finished it.	1.0	0
med_186923	I would like to add my voice to the other reviewers asking-pleading- for a DVD version of Becket. My VHS version doesn't have many years left either, please hurry! Becket is one of the best, if not the best, motion pictures of all time.	5.0	1
med_186924	This film was almost laughable. You think of good fellows at first, and Armand Asanti is really too good and actor to be in this film, his character is overkill. The ending could have been better.	4.0	1
med_186925	Seriously? One hundred and nineteen dollars for a six disc blu-ray set!? In a world where the average person is struggling to pay bills, and on a show that talks of a balanced world where money doesn't exist, this looks like extortion! Fifty-Nine is alot more reasonable and in line with previous releases and other shows of this calibre (i.e. Doctor Who).	1.0	0

The two teens I gave this to were two young girls who lived in a foster home. The movie provided a lesson that they both took to heart and in facing daily struggles, remembered Powder and how he carried forward. I recommend this movie to all ages for all will obtain a different reward!	5.0	1
med_186931	After living 11 years in Japan before returning to the states, my wife and I feel that each time we view Shall We Dance we're transported back.

med_186986	"I first heard about this dvd, because Wendy Robbins said she was in it. I really like Wendy Robbins, because she has so much energy when she talks and her talks are motivating. The editing in the movie is not that good. I don't think there was a professional crew. Just a guy with one camera. Some of the camera angles really annoyed me. Other than that, it was okay. The special features is a plus with interviews of people talking about ""think and grow rich""."	4.0	1
med_186987	Before I bought and watched this DVD, I knew nothing about writing Javascript. Harold Davis is quite knowledgeable and brought a succinct and informative presentation forward. The information was concise and well-presented. For those of us whom had no prior knowledge of Java, it was a very good introduction into the world of Javascript. Production values were good and I thoroughly enjoyed my time spent with Mr. Davis. Thank you Harold and DV Press for your good work.	5.0	1

med_186990	Completely surprised by this movie. Saw the ratings of it and was on Amazon prime instant videos so gave it a shot and loved it. It is violent, funny, vulgar and has lots of surprises and entertaining aspects to it. Yes it has some dumb moments and some stereotypical characters but come with the territory. Maybe I was going in with low expectations but happy I watched it.	5.0	1

med_187027	This MGM compilation represents a pale shadow of the classic Hal Roach shorts. When Roach sold the Our Gang series to MGM in 1938, the creative decline became painfully evident. These one-reel travesties lack the charm and spontaneity of the Roach efforts - underscoring MGM's sledgehammer approach to slapstick comedy. Spanky, Alfalfa and company were badly served in these joyless endeavors.	1.0	0
med_187029	why aren't there any people who have brains reviewing this? this movie completely sucked ballz. with each gag going nowhere, and a plot like swiss cheese, this could hardly be called entertaining. what a waste of time and money. don't waste yours, it treally isn't worth it.	1.0	0

I can't stand the irresponsible, and quite common, practice of allowing the dialogue to come through like mumbling... so you crack up the volume, but then whammo!

med_187058	Where did Kirk Douglas go? I mean, Brian Dennehy is a fine actor and all but it is something I couldn't overlook.

All of that being said, I could tell there was some notable effort on the parts of the child actors, and I hope they continue to act and grow successful!	1.0	0

Impressive!!! Any kid in high school drama class could've pulled this role off. Do yourself a favor and take a dump instead of watching this. A bowel movement is much more rewarding.	1.0	0

med_187140	I was really looking forward to this season and found by the end of it, I just did not care. It was way to violent, not entertaining at all. Sort of sad, really. Because part of this show was a quick wit and it was lacking this season. I thought Michael Westin's character was quite weak. I thought Jesse was the strongest of the supporting cast. The finale was horrible.	1.0	0
med_187142	A delightfully told tale of true events in the life of J.M. Barre, that helped to shape one of the most beloved classics of our time. By far, one of Johnny Depp's finest roles.	5.0	1
med_187143	"This movie was excellent. The fact that Adam wasn't trying to be funny, actually made all the bad things that happened to him (running into stuff, the lighter ""bad things"") much funnier. It's romantic, yet, a different kind of romance. They fall for each other quite quickly and really don't know it. This movie could be watched with any of your friends or your lover."	4.0	1
med_187144	Lip-syncs and all, I loved it! But then, I love Domingo! My husband, The Opera Hater, even watched and enjoyed the travelogue aspect. An especially nice feature: Domingo's duets with himself.	5.0	1
med_187145	I saw the original some 30 years ago and I must say the new version was a lot better. The acting, the actors and the special effects are really great. The new Conan, Jason Momoa was perfect for the part and his acting was so much better than Arnold's. It was well worth the money and time to watch.	4.0	1
med_187146	A minor but effective film noir. Angela Lansbury is beautiful and plays the role with the swagger of the period. Keith Andes has a superb voice. More than one resolution was possible and any would have been appropriate; but the one chosen is satisfactory.	4.0	1

med_187149	Outstanding move! Although the movie is longer than average, 3 hours and 9 minute to be exact, it definitely keeps your attention in exploring many of the conspiracy theories regarding JFK's murder.	5.0	1
med_187150	Where to start... This show has horrible acting (with the exception of Eva Green), poor script writing and the character Arthur is horribly miscast. This series is a horrible adaptation of a great story. I watched the entire season hoping it would somehow recover but unfortunately it only got worse. Many of the scenes are so bad they become actually comical. Not even worthy of 1 star.	1.0	0
med_187151	"I actually liked it! It wasn't different from other ""paranormal investigators die tragically or wind up missing movies"" so I wasn't impressed with that but the plot did keep my interest and that's enough for me."	5.0	1
med_187153	My 4 year old Grandson loves this. I've watched it several times too, and it is great. A nice story with lots of action and good humor. I would highly recommend it. It is his favorite of all the Lego DVD movies currently available.	5.0	1
med_187155	This movie is okay as long as you are a dyed in the wool Scooby Doo fan. I have watched all the others with my 4 year old daughter and we are both big fans and avid watchers of any and all of the scooby doo movies and shows. Yet this one missed us as we both were expecting to see the real Blue Falcon and Dynomutt back on the big screen with scooby and the gang. It is fine but it would have been better with THE real BF and dog wonder!	4.0	1
med_187156	Tatiana Maslany's talent for creating all those sister clone characters defies imagination. She is magic. The story line is getting a little long in the tooth. An occasional resolution would be welcome. But I keep coming back to sere what Maslany will conjure next.	4.0	1

med_187168	This movie was extremely disappointing. The movie tied a several boring stories into one movie. I believe that the creator of this movie attempted to use the nudity and sex to keep the viewers interest. I kept watching hoping there would be a climactic ending or a good twist to the stories that brought them all together. I quickly shut the movie off after it was over wishing I could get that hour and a half of my life back.	2.0	0

My original 1987 tape wore out, and even though I probably have the routine memorized, I am purchasing this product again for the entertainment value that comes from watching Greg in action.

med_187308	Good film. The storyline was clear but the role of some characters was hard to follow and some scenes did not seem relevant to support the plot. The ending felt very triumphant that after discovering that McMurphy had a lobotomy, Chief set him free and then set himself free. Overall, it was a good movie and I would watch it again	4.0	1

med_187321	Left Behind has opened a new door for audiences around the world. Its creative,entertaining, and most of all CLEAN plot is captivating.

med_187322	The plot of this movie was just a little too far-fetched for me to buy into. I also thought the acting was a little over-done, the characters were one-dimensional, and it was overall a disappointing move. My wife and I like Kevin Costner, but even he was a let-down in this movie. Not a great role for him.	2.0	0
med_187323	It wasn't the worst movie I have seen, but I am glad I didn't pay for it. I like movies like this, and it had potential; that is why I gave it 3 star's. If you have to pay for it save your money.	2.0	0

med_187339	"This movie was terrible. Some of the acting and lines were fine, and Statham was good as usual, but the movie had this pervasive racist ""black power"" theme running through it that was very disrespectful of white people.

If they reversed the races, the film wouldn't have been made. Two thumbs down for this odious SJW flop."	1.0	0

med_187472	Loved this show when it appeared on our local PBS TV channel. Decided to get the DVD so I can enjoy the vets whenever I want. The narrator of the audible book is the actor portraying James Herriot in the TV show so it is like meeting up with old friends. I recommend getting their audible book and the DVD. Such a good feeling story.	5.0	1

med_187478	YES! Season Two of this amazing show is finally coming to DVD. Once again, the gang at Imagine and Hurwitz don't dissapoint, as this second roller-coaster season lives entirely up to the legendary first. This will be a must have come October, and will be a great companion to the new episodes of Season Three come this fall. Huzzah!	5.0	1
med_187480	"It was delivered on time since I paid for expedited shipping. I opened the package to watch the DVD tonight and there is a 1/2"" crack on the DVD so the film skips a bit every time it reads the portion on the crack. This is not okay since I wanted to donate it to a local non profit video store."	2.0	0
med_187481	Incredible performance by Billy Bob Thornton, what a transformation from the real actor . I watch this movie 3-4 X a year . It's quite difficult to do the grunting voice and speaking like Karl , I'm still working on it .	5.0	1

med_187489	Bought this DVD as a gift. My son was very happy to receive it. So a couple of days go by and I asked how it was. 1. No subtitles!! 2. Couldn't understand w/o any subtitles. DO NOT BUY THIS DVD. Waste of money spent, and you cannot get your money back.	2.0	0

med_187498	"This movie is made for men with big egos. I thought I was going to watch a movie about natural disaster. Instead my screen was filled with ""man ego"" and it seemed more like a story about a couple getting back together. All in all....THUMBS WAY DOWN. If only I could get my money back..."	2.0	0
med_187501	I was amazed at the way this was written ,i could not figure out what it was trying to tell us , was it trying to say that each person in the story had a problem ,like they were not normal,or do you think the writer thinks the average person is like this. If the average folk were like this, it would be HELL ON EARTH. the actors were great. THE SIX FEET FIT THE TITLE JUST PERFECT> If the end will be like the beginning it will be crazy .	4.0	1

med_187504	I like the movie: I can't play blu ray. I ordered multi format!	2.0	0
med_187505	Weird little movie features solid work from legendary Barbara Steele who can still act just fine, but the pace is slow and it would've benefitted from more screen time for scream queens Adrienne King and PJ Soles both of whom pop up just briefly. The seeds of a plot are there, but it doesn't start to get marginally interesting until the finale, and unfortunately that part of it wrapped up a little too fast.	2.0	0
med_187506	Really enjoyed this movie, yes it follows the standard formula but does a good job keeping you entertained and wanting to know how everything is going to be resolved at the end of the film.	5.0	1

med_187509	Fantastic Product for Any Charmed Fan! I bought this for my 13 year old daughter for Christmas since she is a huge Charmed Fan.. Entire TV Series put in an actual Book that looks exactly like the Book of Shadows from the series.. complete with pages naming some of the Characters from the series... I was super mom this year! Thanks for such a fantastic idea.	5.0	1
med_187510	If ever there was a movie that had more corn in it that the moonshine this is it. The baloney accent that Kate uses is completely bad. In a chase scene the 57 chevy has a headlight out and it turns the corner its back! how did it get fixed so quickly? For my opinion Thunder Road and Moonshine Highway are the better ones,this one is pure dud.	1.0	0
med_187511	I love this movie! The background is gorgeous, the music is well done, and all the side characters are great (I love the bat minion). I also like that Anastasia doesn't sit around doing nothing waiting on her prince while not being so overly powerful as to not need Dimetri.	5.0	1

med_187515	This movie sucked... Already wasn't a Batman fan and this just gave me a better reason why I shouldn't be. This movie was 90% talking and 10% slow paced old man fighting. Horrible Movie!!! Don't waste your money!!!	1.0	0

med_187521	"If you have watched 5 Seasons of Psych, you definitely don't want to miss this season. Some episodes are really funny and good. Some fall flat. The episode where Lasiter buys a ""supposedly"" haunted apartment was not that great. Hence the 4 stars. This season lacks the thrill of ""Yin/Yang"" episodes and shows very little romance between Juliet and Shawn."	4.0	1

med_187541	"While it had a promising plot, I couldn't (for the first half) stop wondering why Nicholas Cage was wearing *so* much makeup. Seriously, so much it altered how he looked. It was just...bad. Once you get past that (if you can) and you get to the ""ghost"" part, again I thought it might be promising but the effects were so over the top and ridiculous that it was just sad."	2.0	0

med_187557	I loooove this workout!! The abs segment is especially awesome. It's so tough and that's what I was looking for! Something to kick my butt into shape!

med_187566	This film is lackluster and often unintentionally comical. Eddie Murphy is the Johnny Appleseed of handguns is this film. He uses a clip, tosses the weapon, uses a clip, tosses the weapon over and over and over again. San Francisco PD could solve their armed street crime problem easily if they would just get Murphy off the streets. He litters the streets with enough guns to arm a small army. Too much gun play, not enough consideration for a quality script. Give this picture a miss.	2.0	0

med_187575	This movie looked fantastic but was all over the place and too long. The plot was not what I was expecting. Parts of it made no sense. Acting was not good-sometimes laughable.

Imagine a story of two old prostitutes (one still practicing her art until March 2013) being poignant, but it really was. These two sisters deserve their retirement and a happy one at that. I highly recommend this film (for adults only of course.)	5.0	1

med_187582	The lack of happiness throughout got me down. Some parts were a little more joyful, but by the end I was left feeling sad. A sad movie wasn't really what I was looking for when I decided to watch Where the Wild Things Are, and so I was left a little disappointed.	2.0	0

med_187611	"Fantastic special-effects and decent story. Good science-fiction. My chief complaint is James Cameron's politically-correct environmentalism. He paints the military in a very DARK way. They are the bad guys, hired by greedy corporations to spoil a peaceful planet. The Colonel is a cartoon caricature of evil military officers. Think ""A few good men"" and ""Apocalypse now"". At 2 hours and 40 minutes, it's a little long. Many of these movies could give up 20 minutes of screen-time and not be hurt."	4.0	1
med_187612	"The clean short version. Characters were completely different from the animated series, and all had different voices. Turns out the entire Doomsday fight is only 8 minutes long out of the entire 135 minute video.

med_187635	This is an older Playboy video, and while many of the women were beautiful, the whole thing screamed cheese. I agree with the other reviewer - it was often far too silly or corny to bring any heat. This one was a miss.	2.0	0
med_187636	"Even though Lina Wertmuller made so many incredible films, in my opinion this is the best one. I've watched it several times, and there is always something ""new"" that you had missed before. The end of the movie is absolutely incredible. Italian cinema from the 70's is amazing, so don't pass on the oportunity to be amazed. Start by the reviews on Amazon to figure out what will suit your taste."	5.0	1
med_187637	I saw this movie when I was like eight, and it made me laugh so hard that I cried. This is one of the movies that any horror/sci-fi collection would not be complete without. This is the campy fun that gets aired at two in the morning. Fans of the genre really should check this film out, they won't be dissapointed, no Oscar material here but then who cares, it is 100% fun.	4.0	1

med_187646	I love Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations Season 1, but was extremely disappointed that it is not the COMPLETE Season 1. Some of the best episodes are missing from the collection. My favorites are Uzbekistan and South Florida. I hope that the rest of Season 1 is released as a collection. I don't think that people should have to buy the episodes separately.	2.0	0
med_187647	Sally is a very gifted photographer and talented writer. The movie does not do her justice. The movie kept my interest because I was hooked by her abilities. Her concentration on the use of antique view cameras and photo processing techniques is interesting but surprising given the unlimited potential she would be able to show us in this digital age. Most everything she does through her huge antique processing effort could be digitally duplicated.	2.0	0

It is not one of those flicks where a vegetarian assaults people for eating baby pigs or labeling them as the cause for the hole in the Ozone layer. Insightful and very watchable. Enjoy the show, and if you happen to generally watch movies with a can of Mountain Dew in hand, you might wand to skip about 5 minutes 2/3 into the film.	5.0	1

med_187660	The instructor has a group of really old people sitting in chairs doing exercise. She runs a good class and puts you through a whole series of stretches then some chair weights. I felt the aerobics section was best done standing. There is no room for improvement if you are more fit. It seems geared to 80 year olds in chairs. I am 63 and would have liked to see some more advanced moves as well. Also more emphasis on knee exercises and balance would have been more to my liking.	4.0	1

Overall, these episodes present Sherlock as a far more dark and unlikeable person than the Sherlock we have all come to know and admire from the Arthur Conan Doyle books.

med_187678	No question...this movie is in the same ranks as the others, although I will agree that this one was not quite as good as the rest. Maybe it's just that some of it comes off predictable.

med_187679	Boy, I've been watching this movie for about a month this week, & I'm still in the first 90 minutes. Turturro is weird, which is why I like him, almost as weird as he was in Big Lebowski. Sigourney Weaver makes you want to sic an Alien on her. Dennis Leary is a throwaway here.	2.0	0

med_187739	playing yourself and being self-deprecating in the process in o way proves you can act. in fact, it proves otherwise; he is unable to be anyone but his egotistical self, unable to empathize with any character but himself. if you were looking for anything that made his action films so great, i.e. bad acting with well choreographed action, move along. if anything, this movie is pitiful in how he's literally begging for viewers to take him seriously in the one thing he cannot do: act.	1.0	0
med_187740	This is just essential for having a close up view of this pioneering movement that charted a course for unknown horizons.

med_187803	Oscar Isaac and Jessica Chastain are subtle and beautifully matched. The concept of a man who isn't willing to stoop to the petty underhanded tricks of those around him even in the face of his own ruin is fantastic and Oscar Isaac is so captivating and powerful	5.0	1
med_187804	We couldn't believe all the cursing in this PG movie. Far too much to go unnoticed by young kids. Aside from that, the kids found far more enjoyment watching the Star Wars Movies and E.T. This one was a waste of time and money.	2.0	0
med_187805	Hard to watch. Would slow down then speed up. Sometimes everyone looked like the three stooges jumping around and scurrying about. Then sudden slow down and voice would not match motion on screen. I will try again later. Could be a glitch in internet or other problem. I have watched other movies with no problem months ago.	2.0	0
med_187806	"..to lookout for anyone else, he's a liability"" ""or else he's working an angle. If he doesn't steal a little, he's stealing big"" Anjelica Huston was impeccable in this role. In fact everyone was great! When I read Jim Thompson, my imajination always paints a very bleak black and white world, but Stephen Frears hit the mark in color, and with much more attractive people. And the music of Elmer Bernstein was a perfect juxtaposition to the noir motif"	5.0	1

med_187813	Yeah, this one is pretty disgusting. Disease from a water supply that's been contaminated leads to a man being called in to source the infestation, while the rest of the town is evacuated. Not only does he trap himself in a septic hell, but also discovers that the source of the contamination is a grisly indication of fouler play. Interesting characters, great effects. Subject matter is not for the weak of stomach, you'll likely vomit. Not a joke. Enjoy!	4.0	1

med_187842	This film is fast paced, informative, and compelling.

med_187855	Just rented this movie and watched with my husband. Not what we were expecting. The beginning of the movie is useless. The drug use and references really didn't add anything to the movie and at times were plain stupid. The directing and writing wasn't terrible but the story could have started in the middle. I wouldn't pay to watch this movie any time soon.	1.0	0

med_187862	This is an ok movie with a somewhat redundent plot, but that is not what makes this a great Blu-Ray in the first place. It is the special effects. In the L.A. tornado scene, you can feel the twisters swirling around you. I noticed tons of debree that i did not notice in the regular dvd. Video is a 5+.	4.0	1
med_187863	BBC depiction of how screwed up American diplomacy is. Isaacs is a good actor (Brotherhood) and the movie starts with an exciting first five minutes. After that it went down hill quickly. When two guys started passionately making out I had had enough. Turned it off. Not my thang.	1.0	0
med_187865	My expectations were low but not low enough. The characters are grownups as conceived by a 14-year-old, the science fiction elements are a jumble of naive, nonsensical, and derivative, the ending is telegraphed early on...Kyle MacLachlan is terrible; everybody else does surprisingly earnest work, thus 2 stars for what is otherwise a stack of hackwork. If anybody took an interest in the conception and writing of this, they must have been ousted early on.	2.0	0

med_187870	Sammo Hung is the only reason why I gave the movie two stars. The movie tries to be deep, but it is just boring. Some fight scenes are OK. Overall a waste of time.

med_187891	Great movie! This is the best live-action (not animated) Cinderella movie I've ever seen and the acting, sets, and costumes were the best. I really loved Cinderella's dress that she wore at the ball, it was so beautiful. The actors were wonderful, especially the actors playing Cinderella and the Prince (later in the movie he was the King) because they seemed so wonderful and had such chemistry together. Overall, this is a wonderful movie and I highly recommend it for everyone.	5.0	1
med_187892	This is a fictionalized reinactment of a true story, if I understand correctly. As such it is much more entertaining that a true documentary. It is worth a watch for people who feel out of touch with young gays. It would also be an educational watch for friends who think your gay experience isn't that different from their straight ones.	4.0	1
med_187893	Bad acting +Poorly written story = Snooze fest. I would have to put this up there on the list of worst movies of 2015. I don't know who thought this was worth 5 or even 4 stars, but if you like this sort of thing ,then good luck. I am open to all genres of movies but this is just bad on so many levels.

med_187947	This director think he's Kubrick. Or Greenaway perhaps. Or Orson Welles maybe. Or...anyway, you know what I mean. Actually, he is a big thief: took some of many of them.

med_187971	This was better than the previous Spider-Man movies. Peter Parker is still a nerd, but is hipper. Jamie Foxx was good as the nerd, and as Electro. Overall an entertaining movie.	4.0	1

med_188014	This is a movie my mother has always talked about as one of her favorites. Apparently it has been on one of the movie channels but she has always missed it.

med_188015	"This movie was awful. The acting was really bad, the script was unintelligent and it has no heart. Lots of bad CGI and ""boom"" sound effects don't make a great movie. This thing got a whole lot of good reviews from somewhere but it will go down in history as a huge stinker."	1.0	0

med_188019	The humor is low and the horror is high!

Jesica Alba stars as his hot girlfriend and Seth Green stars as Devon's duggy friend as well! NOT RECOMMENED! Rated R for nudity, strong horror violence, drug use and language.	2.0	0

med_188027	First saw this film on TV a hundred years ago as a teenager. Has stayed with me ever since and have hoped I would see it once more. Finally it is now available on Amazon in American format DVD and I promptly bought it. The movie was just as intriguing as I remembered it - religion, guilt, sex, maternal love, violence, emotional dysfunction. What more could be asked for? The studio sets are a bit hokey but this is a post WWII British film and should be forgiven.	5.0	1
med_188028	The box says that the 2nd and 3rd films are extended version. But this is only the case for the 2nd, 3rd is only theatrical cut. But despite this, the films are not expensive, and should delight fans of horror movies.	2.0	0

med_188032	This show is really darn good. 25 episode in Part 1 and I think it's the perfect amount for this collection. The only audio is Japanese and there are English subtitles. The music is great too. The story is very interesting, especially among the throngs of Gundam shows.	5.0	1

med_188041	Starts a little slow to develop the new story line, but once the action starts it becomes very riveting. And, naturally they leave the movie open for further episodes available because of some stolen DNA. Chris Pratt did a great job as lead actor and look forward to further adventures of Jurassic expansions.	4.0	1
med_188042	This is not Season 4 episode 2, but rather Season 4 episode 4. It seems whatever process was responsible for making Keeping Up Appearances available on Amazon Instant Video either just blindly guessed at which episode was which, or trusted the labels on the source tapes without actually checking the episodes. This is the fourth episode of this show I've come across that's been a mislabeled duplicate of another episode.	1.0	0

med_188055	This is the abridged kiddy version of the opera. The full production, in German, is actually very good and I have seen it in an HD broadcast in a theater. While there is some justification to issue a kiddy version, I think this also deserves the adult version which is excellent.	2.0	0

They never live up to expectations, they are obviously rushed into production to make a buck, etc. I took a chance on Red Green Christmas last year, and I was pleasantly surprised. It's very funny, well written, and just as good as the shows themselves. Wait until you see how Red takes holiday dinner to the relatives... If you love the show you won't be disappointed!"	5.0	1
med_188065	Definitely suspenseful and a bit scary and creepy, but the plot was predictable and so were all the twists in it. The girl who played Anna had distracting lips. I felt like I was watching an Angelina Jolie wannabe. There are holes in the story, and I didn't really enjoy it excluding the few frightening jumps it gave me.

Not quite as hardcore as Ultimate street brawls.com But pretty decentAlso contains music videos with the whole Jackass gang.

med_188101	A very good, often overlooked retelling of the story of the Little Red Riding Hood. An animated who-dunnit with lively music and fairly decent animation. This movie is in my library because it does what Shrek fails to do. It pokes irreverent fun at some of our most beloved fairy tales and fables without all the unnecessary potty-humor. Shrek easily has five star quality but loses stars quickly on fart jokes and sexual innuendo. Hoodwinked is good decent fun but only 4 star quality.	4.0	1

The ghost scenes from Pirates of the Caribbean were far superior to the ones in this film. By the end of the film you wish Frodo could have fallen to his death along with Gollum. He tried to do too much in this film and the true trophy of this entire series was by far The Two Towers."	2.0	0
med_188112	A very poor, confusing ending. Holds the viewer's attention pretty well throughout with suspense, but really messes up with resolving things in the final episode.

med_188148	Dexter was convincing in his search for the killers-de-jour. I am a fan of Edward James Olmos, and enjoyed seeing him in this and other episodes, even, as it turns out, his character had already come to a bad/frozen end! The sequence of apocolyptic scenerios, as depicted by the Doomsday Killers, was entertaining, as the various paintings or quotes turned into the latest homicides for Dexter and MMPD. Looking forward to Season 7. Thanks.	4.0	1
med_188149	I am watching this on MGM HD and its two star rating on my Time Warner guide may be exaggerated. This is a dull and boring excuse for a movie. The scene with Lowe and the other guy hang gliding away from the Iraqis with their fan propelled back packs was hysterical. This is an awful movie with dreadful acting. Don't waste your time.	2.0	0

med_188153	From a psychological point of view it is not easy to control and monitor your feels every second of the day. The film has great potential; however, I highly doubt the great minds of past and present never had a negative thought or feeling. Many people are motivated by failures and negative thoughts to do great things. The film does not cover this spectrum and I believe its loses its creditably.	2.0	0
med_188155	"The shipping and handling time was reasonable. The price was not bad to be a ""brand new"" movie, however, the audio is very poor. I had to turn my tv's volume up really high and still the audio wasn't good. Also, throughout the whole movie, the audio randomly goes on and off completely, this happens constantly."	2.0	0
med_188156	This is a favorite DVD of mine because Jillian Michaels seriously whoops your butt in 20 minutes, and sometimes a girl wants to exercise in the privacy of her own home. It's a fairly easy routine that can be made more difficult according to skill level.	5.0	1

med_188160	While not always sticking 100% to the facts, this is one extremely well-done movie with first-class acting and cinematography. It portrays the sequence of events leading up to the final battle with breathtaking realism, and offers a compassionate view of the human failures and heroes involved. Definitely worth watching!	4.0	1

med_188169	The sound quality was not good for me. I had trouble understanding many words. Usually I can use the subtitle option but this DVD had no option for that. Very disappointed. The story was interesting, no real plot, just tracking the life of ain't erecting but troubled mans life. The scenery was very beautiful. The cast and acting excellent...but since I cannot understand about 50% of the dialog! I'm donating mine to Salvation Army with my next load.	2.0	0

med_188181	The end of the second Middle Earth Trilogy seems to have inspired the crew and cast to share more, better, stuff than ever before. The Bonus content is so good that we watched those three disks as carefully as the new and expanded scenes in the feature.

med_188183	"At approximately the 27:40 point on the first DVD, we're shown a publicity photo from the movie ""La Bamba"" featuring Marshal Crenshaw, and then incredibly, led to believe that it's a photo of rock legend Buddy Holly. This is a colossal, bumbling amateur mistake. Shame on the producers for using the photo of a guy who once played Buddy Holly in a movie, when there are dozens of great photos available of the real Buddy Holly."	1.0	0

Dramatically staged and lighted but overall experience is ruined by too many closeups, too many shifts in viewing perspective, and too few full figure dance segments.

There's so much to like about this movie -- the theme, the cast, the directing, the cinematography, the script, music & justifying conclusion.

It's a great story very well plotted and every character comes across as a real being and not some card board character just used to tell a story.

med_188306	I would have given the dvd a 5, but the film is a little grainy. Other than that the instructions are clear, concise, easy to follow. It moves along in a nice pace. I have bought numerous dance instruction dvd's and i have liked the Shawn Trautman series the best by far.	4.0	1
med_188307	Matthew Fox is a great bad guy, but this take on the Alex Cross series leaves a lot to be desired. Very little gore and definitely PG-13, which is fine, BUT... the plot is predictable and the flow is hindered by a (spoiler alert) big loss for Alex, that was different than expected, but not enough to make this an original flick. Bummer.	2.0	0

med_188312	When this show first started, I absolutely loved it and was sad when the series ended. Years later I remembered that this show existed and was super excited that I was able to find both seasons on dvd. I watched them right away but was disappointed to discover that my memory of the series was funnier than the actuality. As far a random comedy skits go, this is pretty darn funny but if you're not familiar with the show, you may not enjoy it.	4.0	1

med_188320	Fissure is an unusual video, off-beat from the same old story line. The main character was perfect, battered and haunted by a loss .As bits and pieces are revealed about his story you understand him a lot better, but the case he's been sent on gets stranger. Nothing adds up, is he on the verge of a complete break down??? Watch the video, take the trip with this cop...it's interesting, nothing is what it seems to be...or is it? CC	4.0	1

med_188339	What is it where a director has so little confidence in his own work, that he has to fill in whatever blanks he perceives with incessant music?? I mean, it is non-stop music throughout almost all the movie. When you find yourself fastforwarding to get to the meat of the story, you know you have a loser.	1.0	0
med_188341	Yup, another four bucks and ninety minutes of my life I'll never see again. Just wanted to watch this as mindless entertainment, wasn't expecting much, it didn't even meet my lowest expectations. This disaster was clearly intended for foul-mouthed twelve year-olds. Too bad we can't use negative-star ratings. Never the less, I'll give this a single star in honor of Edward the troll.	1.0	0
med_188342	What I specially liked about this movie is how they dramatized the story of Hosea to help us understand it. The story of Hosea really teaches us how amazing the love that God has for his people is. Yet how painful it is to love someone who you know does not love you back. It really touches your heart.	4.0	1

med_188348	It was suppose to have a blue ray, DVD and digital. It only had the blue ray and DVD even though the cover states that it had all three. It was a gift so it was to late to reture it. So I was unhappy because I did not get what I ordered.	1.0	0

med_188354	I don't know what they were thinking when putting this set together. If you going to update it, you might as well fix the jumpy light saber scenes(new hope). For what I paid for this set I was expecting deleted scenes, original scenes, etc. Nope all you get is a magical audio comments. I would return this nurf turd if I could, but I can't.

med_188378	After all the great reviews, I decided to buy this movie. Well, it was a big fat waste of ten bucks. If you've seen the preview of this movie, then you've seen all of the best parts in the entire thing. It's not funny. It really is not funny. And all of the characters are completely stupid. About three quarters of the movie I turned it off. Just watch the preview, and you'll have seen all of the good parts.	1.0	0
med_188380	This is just another chance for the studio to cash in on the Original Trilogy. The only reason the set receives two stars is for the quality of the films.

med_188478	The movie was good, but Amazon Customer service was lacking. My wife purchased this but happened to be logged into amazon under my account. Our childs movies are all downloaded under her account so that he can watch them on her ipad. Since this movie is loaded under my Amazon work account, it is basically useless. Amazon claims there is nothing they can do to help.	2.0	0

med_188485	I enjoyed this movie. All the actors did a wonderful job and it really keeps your interest. Even though the ending is sad, you can really see what the impact of this little girl's life had on the characters, even though they did not know her a very long time. I love the part after Kate accidentally sees Jake showering outside and then later on comes into her shop to pay for his wine.	4.0	1

med_188489	Don't waste your time with this adaptation. It takes extreme liberties with the book. I've seen every adaptation and the best one was masterpiece theatre 1998 version.

med_188506	Much more than a story of shooting pool, this is a love story between two people who have lost everything in life, except each other. It is especially interesting to watch the performances of a young George C. Scott and the well-coiffed Jackie Gleason; both in significant roles. We cannot take our eyes off of Paul Newman and can't help but like him, despite his con and preoccupation with cigarettes and bourbon.	4.0	1

med_188516	Great actress, made us feel what she is going through. We laughed, squirmed, and got excited with the same movie. It was emotional in many good ways. Events were believable and very close to real life situations. It is a moving story, made me wondered if they will ever get together. Very cute couple and relationship.

med_188519	I guess times have changed but I don't know how this received a PG-13 rating. We've seen other movies with this rating with our 11 yo son, but this was VERY uncomfortable. Mostly funny but some of the dialog crossed the line. Don't know what I expected from Eddie Murphy tho. Not funny enough to outweigh the obnoxious, unnecessary sexually vulgar language.	2.0	0
med_188522	The main characters are all over the place. One episode you see one being very compassionate and caring. The next episode they are not only selfish, but willing to cut off the arm of one of their own crew members to get home faster. The only one that remains consistent is the human.	2.0	0

med_188524	Loved the movie, very touching also it was filmed at a location in Ireland where we had just been in September of 2013 - the only reason for not rating it higher was because some of the language and conversation was such that you couldn't watch with younger children around so not family friendly - the acting was beautiful - ms's Redgrave and Drenth took the show !	4.0	1
med_188525	A good movie that blends the best aspects of Castaway and Apollo 13. Matt Damon is great and very funny at times. Good supporting cast. Well worth seeing.	4.0	1
med_188526	Thus film is unwatchable, but not because of its contents and subject. This film is like a long lost movie that is missing scenes, has white out, chopped up images, broken dialogue, and more. But you keep it anyway for what it represents: one of the very first Holocaust films ever made.	2.0	0

med_188536	Watching this video recently brought back some very familiar images. Seeing Richard Burton reciting corny poetry was a real trip. Even Marlon Brando appeared very youthful in this movie.

med_188539	While I laugh at many of Larry's antics, I am offended by the many anti-Christian themes that permeate this show. He and his wife portray a liberal couple who always strive to be politically correct. Given this posture of the creators and writers (Larry David is both of these), they introduce a typical black family with many of the stereotypical traits so vilified by the political left. This hypocrisy is glaring!!!	1.0	0
med_188540	Normally, I love Matt Damon movies. He is a very talented actor and picks amazing movies to star in. But this movie was a complete waste of time. It's about a guy who thinks that he's being a hero and saving the world but he actually shoots himself in the foot by pissing off what few friends he has. Don't bother watching this movie. I can't believe he passed on playing Kirk in Star Trek for this.	1.0	0

I'm not a very coordinated person and while I CAN get through this dvd after three weeks of every other day use, I don't enjoy it. If you can dance, then you can probably pick it up quickly. Like I said, it's fast paced and would be fun, I just wouldn't recommend it for a beginner.	2.0	0
med_188544	EROS, the distributor for this DVD, has a running advertisement across the top while the movie is playing. It's advertising Akai electronics. Then the movie has commercial breaks to advertise Akai refrigerators. This was making me crazy, and I ended up taping black construction paper across the top of my monitor, so I wouldn't have to look at the ads. Very nervy of EROS!

med_188663	Better then what the reviews suggest. Not the best western ever but worth the watch if you have a slightly open mind. Don't expect a standard western movie, well? its standard with a bit of a twist. If you're a closed minded person who has no wiggle room for a bit of different flavor then you might not like this. I liked it and I'm going to buy it. Kurt has that same charisma as he did in tombstone.	4.0	1

med_188682	This movie hung together very well, from both a human interest and an action perspective. After a bit of a slow start, which introduced the characters and got you interested in them, the director then ramped up into overdrive and didn't let up for the rest of the movie. You rooted for the hero and rejoiced whenever a villain got creamed. The suspense never let up and the ending was very satisfying. Do real life kidnappings end this way? Not usually. But they should.	5.0	1

med_188751	Emma Thompson has given us a wonderful adaptation of Jane Austen's novel, even managing to include the youngest daughter, Margaret, who didn't make it into the much longer BBC version. The casting is excellent, the only quibble being that it requires some effort to believe Emma Thompson as a nineteen year old. They are all delightful actors, though, and I particularly enjoyed the romance between Kate Winslet and Alan Rickman. The sensible daughter gets the penniless clergyman and the impressionable daughter gets the weathy older man.	4.0	1
med_188752	I don't know what everyone else who rented this movie saw but I thought this movie was pretty bad.

med_188823	As a mythical action adventure, this is a very decent movie. As a Biblical epic it is a failure. It is a secularized version of the Exodus story. The visuals and effects are very good.

med_188833	Very disappointed! One of the few movies I've seen in decades that I actually hated. The main characters were silly comic strip caricatures. The Germans were portrayed as 'Hogan's Heroes' type buffoons in the battle scenes. The machinery steals the show because the people are nothing more than props in a 'Rambo' fantasy shot in HD within the setting of Germany in 1945 as a marketing ploy. I want a refund!	1.0	0

med_188890	I ordered this movie for my father because he loved it when it came out years ago. It's the story of an autistic boy who has difficulty communicating and feels isolated from others.

med_188891	I rented this movie last night, and I honestly feel cheated spending 5 dollars to view it. The storyline has more plotholes than you can drive a sequel through. Yes the 'final battle' is as terrible as you've heard, featuring a different camera angle about every 1 to 2 seconds for most of its duration, which will probably leave you dizzy and disoriented instead of thrilled. This movie isn't worth the time to watch even if you're watching it for free. Just stay far away from it.	1.0	0

med_189002	I purchased this DVD because it was cheap and I was looking for some new prenatal workouts to change up my routine. The DVD completely stopped playing after about five uses. I have been doing yoga for about six years and I thought the workouts were too short and not challenging enough for me. Instead, I just do my regular yoga DVD that I've had for years and modify it as the pregnancy progresses.	2.0	0

med_189004	The last in a series of detective story adaptations of the Inspector Lynley novels. We bid farewell to a classic detective team on television with Lynley the aristocrat and Sergeant Havers as the intense and courageous lower middle class sidekick. Great scripts and marvellous performances by all but especially the two stars, well conceived and executed. Sad farewell to a dream team.	5.0	1

med_189006	Gustavo Froes is a great instructor, and the dvds are very detailed with the techniques that are shown. He teaches excellent defensive, and offensive maneuvers from the guard.

med_189008	I'm just really not a fan of the film. I think the acting was done very well, but the story was lacking and I was never invested in the characters. I'm glad I saw it once to experience it, but I don't think I'll ever watch it again.	2.0	0

Nice little video if you collect this kind of stuff. I find this kind of thing very interesting."	5.0	1

med_189036	Such an obvious knockoff of Double Indemnity (1944), some of the initial exchange between Lansbury and the protagonist (an unknown) at the pool reads like the studio screenwriter just substituted the classic Wilder dialogue for moldy scraps. The plot makes no sense; the drama becomes farce by the end. Two stars for Lansbury, looking good and doing what she can to rescue the hopeless plot and dialogue.	2.0	0

med_189038	If you are looking for a film that makes you think what the F did I just watch you've found it. I'm being generous with my rating, there was way too much B-Roll footage in this film. The whole thing could have been trimmed by and still made no sense. Nothing is explained so it's whatever you want it to be. You may do better to read the book to understand it's extraterrestrial in nature but don't expect a why, ever.	2.0	0

med_189058	Very disappointed in this trilogy. Different actors in each DVD, which I find deplorable. The whole set just didn't capture the soul of the books. The characters in the film were pretty much lifeless and dull, so much so that you really don't care what happens to them. I've read the book several times over the years and fell in love with the characters as written by Rand. She is probably rolling in her grave with this adaptation!	1.0	0

med_189074	Six feet under started out being cleaver, humerous and interesting. But now, it has totally gone off the rails. The writers seem to have totally run out of ideas and original thoughts.

med_189092	The characterizations and direction were all excellent; maybe Bluntschli seemed a little young and 'smooth'. The voices were easily understandable, in contrast to many new TV dramas where the speech is so fast that older people like us (79) simply can't follow! We guess there aren't many versions of this to choose from, but we'd certainly recommend it -- it's one of Shaw's favorite plays for us. F.J.H. and I.R.H.	4.0	1
med_189093	I am a fan of The Notebook and A Walk to Remember which are sappy and straight forward romantic movies. There plot twists and suspense ( in a Nick Sparks story?!), which is a nice change.

med_189136	Growing up with The Muppet Show, I really wanted to like this movie. Unfortunately, it lost the kids' interest and honestly I found myself finding other things to do while it was on. The premise is really odd and the movie seemed to creep along way too slowly.	2.0	0
med_189137	The series is enjoyable with its combined humor and story lines. They have gotten creative in season six, which has helped the season as the story lines have gotten a bit far fetched. Apparently the intent of Eric Kripke was to do only 5 seasons. When they decided to do season six, the plots have really stretched to continue the show. Otherwise, it is still a fun show to watch with good ensemble of actors that play their parts well.	4.0	1

med_189139	Great movie! Took some time to get used to especially the part where they steal the baby hogs; all they wanted was a little protein.

med_189176	I have an appreciation for French films. This film is based on a novel that seems more like mental illness by a Mother who threw her household, especially her husband - and son - beyond the boundaries of life's pleasures into all arenas of perversion.

med_189182	This was one of the worst WWI airplane movies I've ever seen. Full of phony looking CGI WWI aircraft, flitting around like spaceships in Star Wars. If you want to see an excellent WWI airplane movie go get The Blue Max, or Wings. This one is unwatchable, and totally hokey. (gives Pearl Harbor a run for it's money as far as being a stupid movie)	1.0	0
med_189183	This was an enjoyable documentary about an artist with an exceptional talent and his friendship with the Dominican nun Jaques-Marie in southern France. Despite the opposition from the Catholic nuns work proceeded and a beautiful piece of art in the form of a chapel resulted from the genius of Matisse. Well worth watching as one can learn so much about the artists of the past and their careers .	5.0	1
med_189184	Wow. Movie was hot garbage from the beginning. The alternate 2016 ruined it from the beginning. Quite possibly one of the worst blockbuster sequels ever. Terrible writing, terrible special effects, terrible costumes. No wonder Will Smith would rather let his character die than to appear in this dumpster fire. Sorry. That's an insult to dumpster fires. Watching those are more entertaining.	1.0	0
med_189186	I am glad I watched this DVD and I certainly agree with the Academy's choice of Marion Cotillard for the Best Actress award, however, I cannot say I will watch the movie again. It was too disjointed, jumping from one stage of Edith Piaf's life to another. I believe the story of this phenomenal life could have been given better treatment.	2.0	0
med_189188	"Following the footsteps of ""Romancing the Stone"" which I thoroughly enjoyed, it's easy to understand why the series stopped here. In the previous film, lightweight though it may be, there is no question that the chemistry between Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner helps make it fun to watch. Not so here. This is essentially a lame attempt at comedy with some ludicrous adventure thrown in. Poorly written it doesn't work very well. I can't totally dismiss it, because of Douglas and Turner but come on."	2.0	0
med_189189	"The title obviously refers to what happens to anybody who watches it. This ""Deliverance"" Aussie-style is just an excuse for savagery.

med_189190	I'M VERY CONCERN ABOUT THE IMAGE THAT THIS MOVIE SHOW ABOUT THE DENTISTS. DOES ANYBODY CARE ABOUT THE MESSAGE THE WRITTERS OF THIS MOVIE ARE SENDING TO OUR KIDS?

med_189209	As a genealogist, I collect period movies. This is one of the first movies I ordered. This story is only one of many stories that occurred during the slavery peiod in this country.

The acting is excellent and the movie is very relevant. I highly recommend it.	4.0	1

med_189241	Hilariously bad acting that goes full-awful during the finale. For the most part, it's pretty much just 90 minutes of an old pervert wanting to watch girls get nude while he also watches a girl bathe in her apartment and have bad dreams. She may or may not be haunted and all that comes of the hauntings are various sounds and CG ghost-smoke that occasionally wafts around.

Excellent script, directing and performances by Denzel Washington, Don Cheadle, John Goodman (a scene stealer), Kelly Reilly & Bruce Greenwood. Not exactly what you expect from the trailers.

med_189342	This movie is BAD!!!!!!! It is so boring and pointless. Oh and here's a news flash: JUSTIN CAN'T ACT!!!! (he can't sing for that matter, but I'm getting off the subject)This movie is about a super model and a geek switching places. WOW! WHAT AN ORIGINAL IDEA! NOT! Don't waste your time watching this movie.	1.0	0

med_189345	I am a middle school teacher in the 49th worst state for teachers. This is all true and then some. I won a major teaching award in my first year of teaching and love the profession. However, I don't know how much longer I can handle it in these conditions. If I ever want a family of my own I can't keep teaching. It would make more sense to go back to waitressing.	5.0	1
med_189347	Great series! I really enjoyed how close to reality it seemed.	5.0	1
med_189348	Gene Tierney is at her most beautiful and Dana Andrews delivers a compelling performance as tough cop with a soft heart. I have seen this movie several times over the span of 40 years. It is still wonderful. Clifford Webb's performance is full of self absorption and obsession. This is a great old classic.	4.0	1

med_189351	Finally a genre film that breaks the rules and holds up as a film in it's own right. A deliberate pacing gives the film an insideous evil quality that stands out from the pack (Thanks to director Eric Fraser and Bruce Payne). I loved the kids (even the ones who deserved to die!) and the photography. This is probably the last in the Warlock series, but all good things must come to an end (and some evil ones!).	4.0	1

med_189356	I didn't expect much from Twilight, but I expected a bit more than I got in this last installment! It was TERRIBLE. I laughed most of the way through it. Is it just me, or were the special effects in this film worse than the ones before it? Did they have a smaller budget for this one? Find a way to watch it for free or just don't watch it!	2.0	0
med_189357	This show has it all...excellent and varied characters that are well developed and well acted, superior writing, and subtle and not so subtle stories about the modern human condition. The characters are interesting and endearing whether you agree with their perspective and philosphy, or not. Each episode is a fast 45 minutes...which is time well spent on quality entertainment. Not much else I can say that has not already been said.	5.0	1
med_189358	Very entertaining. Better done than the British series Ultimate Force.	4.0	1
med_189359	My wife loves this. This is one of her favorites and she will cherish it for a long time. She's always wanted one but the price for the previous version was so exorbitantly priced, highway robbery. This is newer and better quality and better priced, I would recommend it.	5.0	1
med_189361	One of the most boring movies I've ever seen. Plot zero. Acting zero. Production values zero. On par with watching paint dry or ice melt. Watch water boil or cats sleep. You'll enjoy them more.	1.0	0

med_189363	Ya know what really grinds my gears?Take way too many good actors,overcrowded frenetic fragmented video scenes,a poor script,and a thousand over-ripe punchlines,cram it all together in one film and you get a Hell's Kitchen nightmare(horrible recipe) named Ocean's Twelve.	1.0	0
med_189364	Only one line worth uttering all movie. Really really nice visuals. Boring pointless characters that don't grow at all. Still, good enough that I finished, and I'm more than willing to turn a terrible movie off, so it's not the worst.	2.0	0

med_189379	I was looking for a compelling historical setting series to watch. After starting episodes of other series and not finding them enjoyable I decided to give Lark Rise to Candleford a go. I am hooked now. The first episode did a wonderful job of setting up the whole series. You learn a bit about each character and especially the political/social happenings during that time. I always enjoy watching these historical dramas because you come across some of the same actors/ actresses in them from other series.	5.0	1

med_189397	As someone who has long enjoyed and appreciated the original Star Trek series, I think this newly remastered set is fantastic. The video is exceptionally clear and crisp. The re-recording of the theme in it's original score is wonderful. A number of the episodes have little additions given advances in technology. Those additions take nothing away from the origial and are a very pleasant surprise. This set is well worth acquiring for the die hard Trek fan.	4.0	1
med_189399	Not a lot of details about Iron Maiden. Mostly talked about British rock music. Was a gift to my husband who is a huge Maiden fan and he was very disappointed. Which made me disappointed that I spent $25 bucks on this when I could have bought him an Iron Maiden tshirt instead.	2.0	0

med_189406	Vapid. Heavy-handed. Dull, even within the first 15 minutes. Misogynistic. If you're really craving stylized, high-impact visuals, save yourself 117 minutes and watch a music video, or pick up an actual fashion magazine.	2.0	0

med_189411	I have always been a big fan of Nirvana and the Unplugged performance is one of my favorites. My dvd came 3 days early than the expected delivery date so that was cool. The picture quality is so clear. This dvd was not edited so you can watch the whole concert unedited, although you can select to watch the edited tv version of it in special features. Overall the performance was mind blowing, Im very happy with my purchase, it was worth the money and the wait.	5.0	1
med_189413	There's been a lot said about this set, so I'll just say that I was impressed with the quality of transfer, the choices and options of versions, and the additional material to see what happens in the actual production and post of a movie from a standpoint beyond the usual behind the scenes mini features. Still glad I can get a few HD (not Blu-ray discs).	5.0	1

med_189456	The Alamo is a good movie. Some things that really happened at the Alamo happedned in the movie like the Travis guy got shot in the head in the begining of the last fight for the Alamo. The begining of the movie is very boring. And the battle is at the very very end of the movie and after that theres the battle where Sam Huston defeats Santa Annas army in 18 minutes after the Alamo.

med_189461	What's not to like? Great memorable stories. Thought-provoking discussions. Definitely appointment/DVR TV. Suitable for pre-teens and up. Episodes are pretty clean - no trashy language, no overtly sexual or adult themes (unlike standard network trash). Well-acted. Plot line that moves forward as the main character grows. We wish there was a third season.	5.0	1

med_189463	Its a beautiful, realistic love story about sensible people who are overwhelmed by the ferocity and blind determination of the Russian peoples revolution. The set pieces are phenomenal and painstakingly done. Spain becomes Russia engulfed in snow, a country villa becomes an ice palace and a spring yellow flower becomes the illuminating face of Julie Christie, when she recognizes a man from her past.

med_189473	What a wonderful historian! Of course there is always room for some personal interpretation of historical facts. But Professor Schama has a great way of extracting the most important and decisive ones without getting lost in the details (and dates !) of history. The history of his people since he is proud of his Jewish heritage and would never dream of denying it, is at the same time heart wrenching and beautiful. He has successfully and passionately convened this message to us. Thank You!	4.0	1
med_189474	Very bad. I should have trusted my first instinct and not jumped to get this one. Just because a sequel has the same title as the original (The Cell - which was great!) does not guarantee satisfaction.

med_189478	Although the acting was good, the whole film seemed so juvenile... like it was meant for little kids and the filmmakers didn't care to make it superb enough for everyone, letting the extra thing that makes a film exquisite slide.

Also, I like Winnifred as a blonde- Sarah Jessica Parker was just too amazing!	2.0	0

Quite frankly I can't see what one has to do with the other and I was rather ticked off I paid for this thing!	1.0	0

med_189512	Not a great show, thought I'd give it a shot because of it's plot around fantasy football... but the characters are vile human beings, no one has any real redeeming characteristics that makes you want to invest more time in the show.	1.0	0

med_189517	Dr. Karl Boehm is one of the greatest conducter in 20 th century. And the Vienna Philharmonic was his orchestra. This is the opening concert of Vienna Week 1963 and all Richard Strauss Programm. Tod und Verklaerung, Burleske and Ein Heldenleben are very deep, beautiful and splendid. Especially Nikita Magaloff and Willy Boskovsky are very nice. Vienna Philharmonic under Dr. Karl Boehm is very strong and marvellous. Special Thanks to Dr. Karl Boehm and Vienna Philharmonic.	5.0	1

med_189540	This is a B movie that I give a D to. It was shot on a really cheap budget, the scene when the woman is attacked is not that violent or exploitational.

Want to see and feel what it's like to be an immigrant to the United States and to seek out and farm virgin land in a wilderness? If so, then these two movies, ""The Emigrants"" and ""The New Land,"" are for you. Great story telling and beautiful cinematography go into making this combination of films two of the most memorable I have ever seen."	5.0	1
med_189589	Given the way the preview looked and the fact that Gene Wilder was in it I was expecting hilarity. What this film actually delivers is a few moments of dry rapier wit and a whole lot of blegh. Non wonder this film is not very well known it is overall very mediocre. Not horrible just not very good. I felt like the whole thing was one big yawn. Even Wilder couldn't make this film funny or save it in the end.	2.0	0

med_189593	I was very desappointed with this movie. It was way to long and boring, I think the worst part was you already knew how it was going to end, so I felt I wasted the three hours watching it. I have to admit though the scenery was great, and I did like it when they fought the big bugs. I was mostly desappointed because I figured Peter Jackson would do a great job with this movie, but maybe he should stick with directing fantasy.	2.0	0
med_189594	We've seen it twice. The acting is fantastic. There should have been awards for this movie. Personally, I think it should have taken a Best Picture award. *I did not read the book. So, if there are discrepencies between the book and the movie, I wouldn't know.	5.0	1

med_189597	"Took far too many liberties with changing history. While it is produced well and the acting is great, I don't like the idea of rewriting history...it went beyond ""adding dramatic effect"" to actually using wrong dates and wrong events. It's not even accurate to the book it is based off of. Would love a historically accurate version."	1.0	0
med_189601	While I can appreciate the effort of this gangster flick, it just falls flat. The torture scenes are not very violent or intense. Most of the movie, you don't have a clue what's going on. There is a lot of talking in this film, and not much action. Fortunately, I only paid a few dollars for the used DVD from my local Family Video.	2.0	0
med_189602	The friends finale felt like a bad episode. It is so sad that such a great sitcom had to end this way. Where were all the past characters that made us laugh so much. The writing was horrible. It felt like the writers were tired or just didn't care about the fans anymore.	1.0	0
med_189604	"I haven't watched all the episodes, but I've enjoyed the ones I've watched even more than when they were broadcast originally. Also, since the series was already half over when I ""discovered"" it on SyFy, this collection will allow me some great new episodes to watch. Heck, anything with Amanda Tapping in it HAS to be good!

med_189614	The blue ray quality is outstanding. The movie, a Hayao Miyazaki, is what you'd expect, another gem.

med_189627	I saw this film when I was in college. It is one of the best war movies I have ever seen. The movie gives you the German perspective without trying to vindicate them or anything like that. It simply shows how everyone became a victim of something bigger than themselves: war and the winter in Russia. It is a very good movie an a must for fans of WWII movies.	4.0	1
med_189629	I will not crack on the acting because it was not the acting that made the story good or bad. However, the story line was horrific and made me want to shoot myself in the foot; downright depressing. We are from Nebraska and yes, the towns and attire fit what we knew growing up but the attitudes? We spent the whole movie wondering if Payne was making fun of Nebraskans or if he really saw us as that depressing and mundane.	2.0	0

Doesn't shy away from the realities of the Nazis nor the typical fantasy musical scenes.

Well, I didn't like Mr Slate or Kazoo as you'd expect for a child watching a cartoon when a character was causing trouble for the star characters. The packaging was a surprise.

med_189743	This movie has no dialogue and it's like the same story for more than an hour. I thought that I was going to be impacted, but I wasn't. If there was dialogue, this movie could have expanded more and went more into depth about how radically people's lives were changed.

med_189754	From the very start of the movie we know that something bad is going to happen involving Kevin. The movie is just one large build up and it feels as if the climax will never happen. The constant back and forth between past and present was really annoying. I'd say watch this movie if you're into creepy kids and a long drawn out story.	1.0	0
med_189755	I don't even know where to begin. This movie was awful. It was painful to try to watch and I GREATLY regret spending $3 to rent it on here. The acting is abysmal. The writing fails both in over-arching story and individual scene dialogue. The sets are expensive, but the special effects are worse than 1990s CGI. Skip this mess.

med_189760	This is a show that airs on a FREE station. So the fact that Amazon is charging this much for an episode to begin with is shameful.

My only regret is that the hilariously edgy comedian Sarah Silverman was given such a limited role as the shrewish girlfriend. But aside from that, I highly recommend this film!	4.0	1

med_189765	I had very low expect ions for this, and it largely lived up to those. I don't laugh out loud once, and found some of the situations humorous mainly because of how well Seth and Barbara sell the parts.

med_189775	The Hunger Games was an amazing book that was fresh and creative. This is another movie with too much money that placed more emphasis on the background than the actually central plot. The acting was poor, except Cinna and Haymitch. The familiar faces of acting Katniss and Peeta took away the purpose of a random pair that was chosen from the Reaping. The movie had the general storyline, but did not fulfill my expectations	2.0	0

med_189866	This movie is really cute and sweet and dumb. It's also really funny - not the funniest out there, but still has some good laughs. The only reason so many people hate on it is because Paris Hilton is in it. Honestly, it could be any other actress playing her role, and people would love it. It's definitely no Academy Award winner, but hey, it is entertaining! And it has a message about inner beauty.	4.0	1
med_189867	Kind of stupid. Watched the whole thing and still...nothing happened. Some father to son talk about being a man and owning up to your mistakes..lies...errors. Then the end show the father violating all that. It was foreshadowing that was not even slightly shadowed. You knew it was coming. And it did. Guy loses job, hides it form his wife and kids, they take him back after finding out....and the father goes against his core beliefs. Text book.	2.0	0

If you've read the book, you won't be disappointed. If you've not read the book, you may be a little bit confused by some of the humor. This is a British comedy, so the humor is a little bit dry but it is definitely worth the watch.	5.0	1

med_190033	Nice cowboy documentary film with a very informative cowboy commentary. Overall good print quality with some bad splicing during dialogue at one spot. My copy had some digital break-up in spots during the film which looked like they occured during the production process. The extra TV documentary on ghost towns is quite good with no break-ups. It says it is program #3, but I have not been able to find any other episodes of this program listed.	4.0	1

med_190041	There have been a few horror/thriller movies out of Korea i've been enjoying recently and FLU is one of them. Make sure to turn on your subtitles if you don't speak Korean because it didn't provide them. Zombie action was great and pretty realistic, human reactions were a bit overdone in some scenes but I've come to expect that from some of the movies out of Asia.	4.0	1
med_190042	I saw the movie 24 hours ago. It's an eye-opening, witty, fearless piece of work that is LONG overdue. All I have to say is: It's about time somebody stood up and said something about the fear campaign media overdose in America. Michael does a great job at plainly, brilliantly stating the truth about the government, guns, and fear in America.	5.0	1

med_190045	The soundtrack on this film is truly horrible... HOWEVER, I did find that by adjusting the balance completely to the right, I was able to hear just the dialogue, without the dreadful, invasive sound effects track getting in the way. The DVD is unwatchable unless you do this!	2.0	0

med_190052	I gave this series a fair chance. Three episodes in and I can't say that any character is even remotely lovable. The characters are all very irritating and void of anything to latch on to. Most of the time I found myself very irritated by the dialog and lack of any thoughtful or emotional content to attach to. I wanted really badly to like this show but again... Empty. :(	1.0	0

med_190077	Nice new twist on the old time travel theme. Loved Emily Blunt, her best role to date, wonderfully done. Even Tom Cruse gave a creditable performance leaving out, for the most part, his macho stuff and did a nice job playing a somewhat reticent character during the training scenes. A little dissapointing at the end, but all in all an enjoyable sci fi movie.	5.0	1

med_190099	I may be biased, but I love a British mystery series. Although most I watch are period pieces....this is a great present time series. The characters are wonderful, and best of all, real and relatable. David Tennant, so great as Dr. Who, plays a totally different character here, but just as great. Only 6 episodes, at times a little slow, but the series is about the people, not just the mystery. Watch, you will enjoy	4.0	1

med_190102	"Somewhat formulaic romantic comedy, with the exception that both of the main characters have some ""issues"" to deal with. I really wish the ending could have been different from the typical ""into the sunset"" but the performances were strong (especially by Robert deNiro - who I thought played someone who had his own issues in a really subtle but convincing manner). All in all a decent way to spend a couple of hours."	4.0	1
med_190103	The Third: The Girl With The Blue Eyes is a must see for anime lovers. At first I thought I wouldn't like the main character, but as I kept watching it she started to grow on me.

But I don't mind going back and watching it all over again :) This is an anime to keep!	5.0	1

med_190110	The score to this film was flawless but, the movie itself is just another average in my book. Marilyn Manson did the score for this movie and he did a job! If you watch the commentary to this movie they said that they didn't want to show zombies in the beginning because, you knew that you were gonna see some any way. The film didn't even have enough gore to be a serious zombie movie. I give this 2.5 stars.	2.0	0

med_190112	First of all Christian Bale is one of my favorite actors, that being said don't waste your time watching this movie. I must have told myself five or six times turn this horrible thing off.

med_190121	Character development is very shallow--it's hard to feel for either one of these guys because the dialogue has them bitching at each other for the first 25 minutes. It starts as a downer and ends as a downer. Near the 2/3rds mark they manage to capture some real emotion about transition from divorce to singlehood and the struggles of finding yourself alone. The final scene leaves the view going...wth?	2.0	0
med_190122	It appears that have been a good concept in theory but just poorly executed. The story line was OK and the best acting was done by Russel Crowe but thats really not a surprise. It was cool to see Lucy Liu in a movie and her acting was pretty good as well. Overall the movie just falls short of having good fight scenes and better development of character. Its entertaining and only worth watching as a rental so I am glad I did not see it in the theater.	2.0	0

med_190129	Juvenile and boring, the plot makes little sense, the dialogue is boring, the styling of the characters makes no sense, and the relationship between Cade and Tessa is unbelievable and creepy. All of this could be forgiven if the action were better, but once again, we have muddy pointless fight scenes with the choreography of 5 year olds on the end of a sugar high. It is slightly less pointless than the first two transformers movies (I never saw the 3rd.)	1.0	0
med_190130	"This movie was very revealing of the types of things we need in our society today especially for the young african american young men today.

med_190133	This DVD was a pure disappointment- boring and totally against what you expect from it.

med_190197	Slow and a bit depressing. It explores a lot of the downsides to family relationships without much of the positive side. The characters just didn't come off as believable. Disappointed.	2.0	0
med_190198	What can I say that no one who loves the film has said already? The movie is great! great acting, great fight scenes, fun, lots of action, SFX serving the story instead of it taking over the story. I loved the characters. Watch it and see for yourself how great this film is.	5.0	1
med_190199	It's one of those movies where every time you think you know what happened, someone explains all the things that they didn't show you the first time, and now you see what REALLY happened. The twists and turns defy imagination, but more or less fit together in the end. The banter is witty, the effects are splendid, and the comeuppance is satisfying. Who cares if it's all pretty much impossible. Who's to say what's possible anyway?	4.0	1

med_190208	We worked through this and if it wasn't for Robert Redford being the main (only) character, this probably would be sold for $1 or put on prime. In addition, The website and the Roku connection says $3.99 and we were charged $4.99. I'll try to get the dollar back in credit, but this is very trying...	2.0	0

med_190213	This is the best episode of the season so far. Young Mr. Bates shows what he will do to protect his friends. He doesn't hesitate to jump back into the frigid waters to pull her out and barks orders for blankets and oxygen like an Army Nurse. Then, when his friend who betrayed him out of concern is attacked, he tosses the pervo across the room with the strength only found in psych hospital patients.	5.0	1
med_190214	Some of my favorite aged actors who got together for an obviously superficial piece of fluff. The film itself is of poor quality with lines running down it and many skips.	2.0	0
med_190215	I had no big hopes for another movie from this well overworked franchise, but they pulled this one off extremely well. While it certainly had its fair share of shoot-em-ups and action scenes, I actually caught up in the character interactions and their differing points of view. Unlike the usual film of this sort, the dialogue was actually intelligent and well delivered the actors. An unexpected pleasure.	4.0	1

med_190230	Rude ,snarky narration that brings down the integrety of documentaries. Low carb diet, whether it comes form fast food or not will yield the same result. Constant negative about Super Size ME, is always easier to criticise than to be the first I guess. I think the point on Super Size Me was the quality of the food from these places. Regardless of the weight gain/loss, the food sold in these establishments is a chemical copy of the idea of food. Nothing new learned in this doc, sophmoric.	1.0	0

med_190249	Wes Anderson makes beautifully funny movies, with great characters and cinematography, and perfect soundtracks. Herman Blume's cannonball, especially the aerial view of his tanned, corpulent body over the dully blue pool, is hilarious. I recommend this movie unreservedly.	5.0	1

med_190252	This movie will set chills down your spine at almost every turn. You are all wondering if they meet their maker you don't want to know. A gruesome tale of how are creators now sought out to destroy us. They see us as an experiment gone horribly wrong. If you like the aliens series you'll love this movie.	4.0	1
med_190253	this is one of the best movies ever, bar none. kate winslet should have won an oscar for her performance here. james gandolfini, susan sarandon, mary louise parker, aida turturro, bobby canavale--all superb performances. i've watched the movie five times...just cannot get enough of it.	5.0	1

med_190273	I first heard of this movie as a slam-bam, chase flick. Little of substance, much mayhem. After avoiding it for many years, I finally took a look. As the climax ended, I found I was crying. It was so inevitable, yet by the time the car hits the barriers, you want him to stop, escape, live again. Kinda reminded me of Dead Man, as this guy is taking a journey before he dies. It is simple, revealing, heart-breaking.	4.0	1

med_190275	What were they thinking? Obviously they weren't, with such a ridiculous film. The sad thing is it's a waste of good talent. JLo has great charisma on film and Alex O'Loughlin was hypnotic in Moonlight yet somehow managed to come across in this film as a real nerd. So many gimmicks in the film and an unbelievable 8th grade dialog and plot make this film simply unwatchable.	2.0	0
med_190276	This strange film is based on a book by a former British television newsreader and is a combination of love story and ghost story. The settings are striking and the music score effective but it's a slow affair and one is baffled as to what market the film-makers were aiming for. It still remains worth watching however if only for its being such a rare commodity in combining monster movie and love story.	4.0	1

med_190307	This was a boring piece of crap. Unlike some other SF movies like Buckaroo Banzai and Starship Troopers which don't make complete sense but challenge you into trying make sense out of them, this one was deliberately, pretentiously obfuscatory but in no way made it enticing to attempt to find out the details.

med_190378	In watching REPTILIAN, you'll have to ignore the horrendous acting, and snicker at the so so special effects. At times, it almost looks animated like a cartoon and other times it howls back to the days of the fifties. And all of a sudden, Yongarry decides he wants to help us out, too! Only if you want a good laugh will this howler entertain you!	2.0	0
med_190380	Clever? Heartwarming? Positive? Excellent acting, love the actors, but this is one of the bleakest, most depressing movies I've ever seen. Humans with no hope, at their worst. If you think it gets better at the end, it doesn't.	1.0	0

med_190387	I love film noir. I like many Polanski films. I hate Chinatowm. So why does everyone and their dog love this boring tripe? Perhaps I've seen too much REAL noir or something. I can't put my finger on it, but every scene in this film feels like fake noir. Even the Coen's can do noir, but this film stinks.	2.0	0

med_190393	Our son is 4years old and he did not like phonics until we got him the DVD. Now he loves it and most of the times he has a break and he wants to watch TV, he asks for Letter Factory.

med_190397	One of the best action flicks of all time. Great cast, great story line, it's believable, car scenes are awesome think Steve McQueen bullet but non over the top CGI.	5.0	1
med_190398	So very disappointing! How can you have such an amazing cast and have the movie be so terrible. The acting is terrible. (Diane Keaton, really? is that possible??) The acting seemed to be over the top....the plot sad at best. I had such hopes for this movie and dashed. If you have another choice to watch...take it. Diane, you let me down...Bad dialogue, bad acting, bad directing.	2.0	0

med_190402	This show may be trying to make good points, to present ideas/opinions that may (or may not) be valid, but the plots are so heavy-handed, the acting so poor, the ideas so stereotypical as to be embarrassing.

med_190407	Great example of what sugar will do to you and your body from all the hidden sugars that are in everyday food items that we think are healthy. I felt bad for the actor, you could see the pained look on his face towards the end of the movie as his body succumbs to sugar toxicity.	5.0	1
med_190409	The 1960's Gene Deitch cartoons are not good. Release Golden Collection Volume Two and everyone will buy it. There are over 150 reviews begging for Golden Collection Volume 2.

med_190416	As noted by other reviewers, the quality of the DVD is lacking. Having read the reviews prior to purchasing the DVD, I expected that and was not disappointed. I do not consider myself to be a good dancer but I can find the beat and shimmy a bit. With that, I was very disappointed in the dance material itself. The instructors gave no more education then what I could have learned watching the basic striptease scene off of my favorite rated R movie.	2.0	0
med_190417	Worst film has been watched for a long time, the story line is awful. The acting is too much, especially the bad guy, all on his face already. Never, bother to find/discover the human inside. Do not waste your time as I did. I will give no stars at all, but I cannot. it has default one star.	1.0	0
med_190418	I was very disappointed in the work out video. These were some of my favorite dancers and I just felt like it would have been more fun if it was easier to follow and there was a group with some music. Overall just disappointed.	1.0	0

med_190429	"I agree with one of the previous reviewers. The plot was very weak. Too often I was left saying to myself ""ok, what's the point here?"" I did enjoy certain actors' ability to take on diverse roles, but when it came to substance.......a needle in a haystack."	2.0	0
med_190430	Food for thought. Leans a little to the right but worth watching.	4.0	1
med_190431	The portrayal of an American company that allows these shenanigans to happen in a corporate environment is ridiculous. No one would allow the types of behavior displayed in this film between coworkers and promote an assistant in this situation to the level after returning. Unfortunately, it made this film difficult to watch. Character development was a thin patina of a deeply complex humans in a stressful, traumatic environment. Go Daniel!	2.0	0
med_190432	Take a quick trip back to 1964. The place is New York City and the setting is the Beatles on Ed Sullivan. That halcyon time of innocence and gaity, screaming mobs of female (and male) fans and that paragon of early TV, Ed Sullivan, who brought entertainment into the lives of ordinary Americans every Sunday Night. Six teenagers from New Jersey descend upon New York City to meet their idols, the Beatles. It is a bit wild, very funny and sometimes poignant.	4.0	1
med_190433	Jeremy Brett is the definitive Sherlock...what more could be written about his portrayal. Everyone needs this complete collection in their movie library.	4.0	1
med_190434	I only ordered this because I'm in the movie. It's actually a pretty bad movie! If you like Raquel Welch or The Mission Inn in Riverside, CA, you might like it, but I doubt it.	2.0	0
med_190435	Nice show, gets a little weird and hard to follow, but I enjoy watching it.	4.0	1
med_190436	Great story with a TERRIBLE ending!! Very depressing--I would recommend you skip the last 7 minutes of the film. This could have been one of Clint Walker's better films without the crummy ending.	2.0	0
med_190437	I have thought thst Sean Connery excels in this. Maybe because I saw it over 20 times when it was released! Still my favorite although the props are old by today's standards.	5.0	1
med_190438	There are many times when Robin William's talent as a comedian has made me laugh. However, this particular show rarely did. There was some good material, but I felt the pervasive foul language and body functions topics significantly lowered my enjoyment. Maybe some won't mind, but I did. Buyer beware - the mature rating is accurate (if not an understatement). Not family friendly.	2.0	0
med_190439	Audrey Hepburn and Fred Astaire were wonderful together in this movie. The dance scenes are very well done. It is a good movie for all ages of family members.	4.0	1
med_190440	Odd movie. Good looking cast, story had potential, but instead of just speaking all the dialogue most of the movie is Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet.	1.0	0

med_190447	I purchased this as a gift for my best friend who loves anime. Trouble Chocolate is a classic. It reminds me of Sailor Moon. Full of humor. The animation isn't like that of today, but one needs to keep in mind the era that this anime was made. If something a little off beat and nostalgic is what you want, this series is for you.	4.0	1

med_190453	I like the way the actress plays the part of Esther. Very positive and very attractive. Of all the movies of Esther that I've seen, I like this one the best. It's also appropriate for kids.	4.0	1
med_190454	"I really loved seeing a wide range of cultures and faiths answering ""What is God?"" Of course the celebrities were also very interesting. It was great watching all the extended interviews. I found David Coperfield's response particularly thoughtful as he is a professional illusionist."	4.0	1

med_190464	"A refreshingly different film made in Ireland. The unknown actors added to the interest and enjoyment. I wanted to watch this film because I learned it was John Carney's 2007 ""earlier version"" of Begin Again (2014). Being set and made in Ireland ((Dublin), I was fascinated to see it and hear the Glen Hansard music. The romantic story was captivating and the music excellent. I was not disappointed."	4.0	1
med_190465	Not recommended for all seniors as it requires average to above average flexibility. I do the warm up and then select one or two dance sessions. Once I am able to do these with relative ease, I will add more until I can do the entire DVD at one sitting.	4.0	1
med_190468	Funny, good story line, and Sandra Bullock is always terrific. He makes a great foil. Scenery is delightful, even if not filmed in Alaska.	5.0	1
med_190470	There is not much plot. It is mostly a series of unfortunate and meaningless events.	2.0	0
med_190471	The story behind Katsuragi character as a dating Sim campion has expressed his opinion on women and retrieve back to shell, but what makes this story so hilarious is how he seduces, dates and release demonic loose souls within them only these souls to be captured with a cookie jar by Elise.(laugh).	4.0	1
med_190472	This movie was a bit of a disappointment. We weren't expecting a complex plot, but we had expectations in terms of acting. Instead, the cast was really mediocre as the actors, both young and adult, seemed almost to read from their scripted parts. At one point, we thought the dog was also reading the script...The best actor was the wild bear.	2.0	0
med_190473	Great group of actors but terribly disappointed with this 2 part miniseries. The actors were simply too old for the characters that they played at the beginning of the series. Elisabeth was in her early forties at the beginning of the story....	2.0	0

med_190484	A wacky in depth look at what makes Cubs park and its neighborhood tick! Smartly written, nicely shot, and frequently laugh out loud funny. Cub fan & TV star William Peterson narrates the film like he's lived it. I recommend this highly and consider it a must have for every baseball fans library.	4.0	1
med_190485	It's good but it's missing two of his films 1 the directors and 2 space balls but other than that it's still good for a partial collection	4.0	1

med_190487	If you have never read the comics you will love this movie. If you HAVE read the comics you will still get a kick out of this well put together thrill ride. Swanky cinematography and very interesting casting! One of the better comic to movie efforts! Go see it and you will have as much fun as we did.	5.0	1
med_190489	I liked the premise of the film but was soon dismayed by the graphic nudity and the overall depressing atmosphere. I suppose it was to seem quite realistic except for the fact that chaplains and trained personnel usually go in a team to make the KIA notices.	1.0	0
med_190490	"She's very dedicated. The workout was good, hard. I think her words got a little harsh at times, weren't super encouraging but rather said things along the lines of ""this is going to be so hard!"". I don't dig that kind of talk, makes it seem almost harder than it is. Also, making it an hour and incorporating more stretches would be more beneficial."	2.0	0
med_190491	What a shame. They took a really interesting true story and made a lousy movie out of it. By the end of this disappointing film I was so tired of seeing Angelina Jolie in that hat pulled down over her eyes. It's really hard to judge her acting by seeing only her mouth, but in this case, I guess it really doesn't matter. It's not even worth the $3.88 they're charging for it today.	2.0	0
med_190493	I don't understand all the positive reviews. There are plenty of other movies where you can watch Scarlett be hot without insulting your intelligence repeatedly. The premise is dumb, the plot is dumb, the outcome is dumb, and I thoroughly regret parting with my money for this movie in any format.	2.0	0

med_190496	I THOUGHT IT A VERY GOOD DEPICTION OF THE WAR YEARS. THE LANGUAGE SUBMARINERS USE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN STUCK TO, CREATING A FEELING OF REALISM, WHILE THE PLOT WAS TAUT AND BELIEVABLE. OF COURSE, FEW KNOW VERY MUCH ABOUT THE GERMAN CODES DURING WWII. THE ENIGMA MACHINE WAS CAPTURED ELSEWISE, BUT IN THIS PICTURE IT IS USED TO CREATE THE NECESSARY TENSION. AN OVERALL SUCCESS!	4.0	1

med_190498	Okay, so I really wanted to like this movie. But I have to confess, I do not like Kristen Stewart as an actor. She is as flat, annoying and one dimensional in this as she was in Twilight. I guess I was just hopeful that she'd be better. Maybe I was counting on the supporting cast to inspire her to greater emotion and acting ability. Is it wrong that I rooted for the queen? If you want a decent Snow White movie, try Mirror Mirror instead.	2.0	0
med_190499	My sister told me about the movie, seemed interesting. After watching it I was kind of disappointed. I didn't really like it, I felt it lacked reality specially the ending; I suggest watching the real experiment it's much more interesting and real. (...) [...]	2.0	0

med_190525	A lot of build up for very little pay off. The idea of meeting a future version of oneself is ripe with possibilities, but this film just doesn't get there.

med_190601	The movie centers around Robin Williams, who dropped a ball in a football game some years ago, and cannot get over it. He tries to reunite the team to relive the game and finally catch the ball that he missed. I did like Russell's performance but Williams was just out of place. Really, Robin Williams playing football? There was alot of storyline errors that never added up and the ending could be seen from the opening narration.

med_190723	got it thinking it was made of good material but to my surprise it is plastic n not a very impressive piece ... plus got it at a very high price ... had to buy an other original sideshow thing just to get out of the shock ... should not be worth more than 100 $ ... people selling it for are just ripping you off ... i too got ripped ... there should be more detail in the description section ... n more pics to show what this really is	2.0	0

med_190727	Very long, drawn out religious movie of a family's misfortune in the desert. It starts with the Mom falling off a cliff and doesn't get much better from there. Dad's a total jerk, but then finds God. The daughters makeup remains unchanged after being lost in the desert for days.	2.0	0

med_190743	I was severely disappointed when I received and watched this DVD. It is 2 hours and although Donna is very energetic and fun to watch, the video is just an assembled / edited video of different workshop segments. There is not truly much substance.

med_190748	This movie was misleading as I thought it would be about witchcraft. I was bored to extinction; the plot was predictable and the acting flat. What happened to Nicholas Cage,he was excellent in Moonstuck and has now spiraled into very poor film choices?The so-called witch character was not interesting, nor likable as villian or victim.

med_190783	I'm a huge Kevin Kline fan, but this movie is really not representative of his best work. The story was just uninteresting. The acting was great but the story was just boring.

med_190786	This movie has no beginning and no real ending. It is simply about a man on a sailboat at sea who wakes up and finds that his boat has a hole in the side and is taking water. There is no plot, no personal information about who this man is, why he is alone, where he is going, what he is thinking, etc. The whole thing is about how he worked hard trying to keep his boat afloat.

med_190788	Ryan Gosling.....He is a great actor in every role including this one and he is just gorgeous. The camera loves him and so do the fans. Paul Giamatti was brilliant as usual but I felt disappointed by George Clooney in this film. He's a wonderful actor but I thought he seemed bored and lackluster throughout it. A shame! But otherwise the movie was very good, exciting and well cast. Ryan needs HIS Oscar! He has deserved one for YEARS of great works.	4.0	1

med_190790	What started out as a great series eagerly followed by fans was made into a mockery by this last season. It is as if the writers all quit and then the producer told everyone to wrap it up in a hurry and they developed a quick, unsatisfying ending. Rather they had made a 2 hour movie if that was the intended way of the ending.	1.0	0
med_190791	Another decent film from Sweden made in 2011. Starring Bill Skarsgrd, son of Stellan, brother of Alexander who does very well as the talented ice hockey player. Another fine performance comes from Alicia Vikander who really stands out in this. With just under two hours of fine acting, the film is in Swedish with English subtitles. Well worth a watch!	5.0	1

med_190889	I am on my second Collection now and not all of the discs work in this set either. The first set contained discs that would freeze up my BD player (3 out of the first 5) so I returned it for a different set. In the second set I got to disc 9 before it froze my BD player. I have enjoyed the movies but don't know how may sets I'll have to go through to find one that works completely!! Where is Quality Assurance in this production!	2.0	0

med_190891	This is one of my favorite movies as a child and I was psyched to find it on DVD. The only down side is that it is missing 3 scenes from the original broadcast and with these scenes missing it doesn't always flow right or make sense. I contacted the Jim Henson company and they would not or could not do anything about it. Otherwise a great Muppet movie.	4.0	1

med_190895	It was great to see soap opera stars on the big screen in a really good movie. The movie puts Rick Hearst in traffic frustrated each day about getting to work, but he discovers a unique way to overcome this adversity. With twists and turns and humor Jeanne Cooper and Tony Geary add to the very funny story line that some of us do live. Other soap stars add their best efforts to make us all glad we saw this very funny movie!	4.0	1
med_190896	Loved this movie. It's supenseful without being horrific, and will keep you on the edge of your seat. All the acting is superb; there are no weak characters. The only thing that stops me from giving this movie five stars is that it drags for about thirty minutes toward the end, but the end is well worth the wait. See it if you can; get the pop corn, settle back, and enjoy.	4.0	1
med_190897	Kristine Opalais brings great intensity to the oddly-composed leading role (Rusalka is mute for half of the opera) and redeems the dismayingly cnynical production; in place of the fairy tale, this Munich production turns the Water Goblin into a Castro-like pedophile and abuser and Jezibaba the witch into a nasty enabler of her predatory husband. Without Opalais' dramatic urgency, this production would be unrelievedly nasty--more Hobbes than Rousseau on human nature. Such a produciton simply diminishes Dvorak's luminous score.	4.0	1

med_190900	Great production values but highly stylized nonsense. Just another rather pointless and totally unbelievable martial arts diversion. You never care about the people and there's killing and dying aplenty. Apparently ninjas don't do well against western technology like Gatling guns despite their ability to defy physics. Too bad they all look like clones, but then you don't need individuality from cardboard. The drunk turned gunfighter is borrowed from Cat Ballou, a much better movie.	2.0	0

med_190917	A Simple Plan was an enjoyable enough movie played well by Paxton, Fonda and especially Billy Bob Thornton (who really should have won an Oscar along with a nod for his excellent performance in U Turn) but I couldn't help thinking it was too like Shallow Grave crossed with Fargo to stand on its own merit. The plot has been seen a thousand times before but the atmosphere and tension were pitched just right. A little more originality next time please but top marks for popcorn value.	4.0	1
med_190918	This product was delivered quickly and in good condition. If you like monster movies--critter flicks--this is one of the best. The film is better than the book, which was good but in need of streamlining--a minor flaw corrected in the screenplay. The Relic critter is awesome, the FX crew doing a terrific job in creating a credible monster. Only (minor) complaint I have is the use of a few off-the-shelf sterotype characters. This is a foundation flick for the monster buff.	4.0	1

med_190934	This video does a thorough background of Ayn Rand which explains that by drawing from her personal experiences how the US was getting off track.

med_190940	I first saw this movie when I was nine years old on VHS and was enthralled by it. I have searched for this video since then and to my surprise it came upon me on amazon! This movie is a great movie. My family and I all sat down to watch it and everyone enjoyed it. I give this movie a 4 star because it is not as magical as it was when I was a little girl. This movie is still a wonderful movie!	4.0	1

med_190964	I bought this father's day and it looks wonderful. The only small annoyance is it's hard to slide the disks out and I keep worrying that I'll tear the page or scratch the disk.

med_190965	This video is okay, but I was looking for something that would be more of a workout.

med_190983	Hey the reviews below are irrelevent. I should know. I say a lot of the same thing about most movies I was in this genre, but his movie is effective if you don't automatically assume that it is silly. In fact, I found the robot killing machine quite creepy and the light humor purposeful. It is not supposed to be an all out serious movie so don't expect one. Ahhh, what am I saying. What do you care anyway?	4.0	1
med_190984	This early Verdi opera is seldom done. It doesn't have the immediacy and impact of his later work and is in more of a recognizable Bellini-Donizetti mode. The performance and production are more than satisfactory but less than inspired. For serious Verdians, this is a must. For the more casual operagoers, an option.	4.0	1

med_191055	The movie would have received 4 stars but the villain was just unbelievable.... The bad makeup and jaw thing was terrible! Other than that the plot was good...	4.0	1
med_191056	I knew this movie was awful when I bought it. I saw it on Mystery Science Theater 3000 and I wanted to watch the unfffed version. Amazon had it and it was dirt cheap so I bought it. Don't worry. It's awful.	2.0	0
med_191058	As monster movies go it was pretty good. It was kind of like a Godzilla movie but with an actual plot. Yes the physics are completely ridiculous, but if you just want lots of cool fighting and explosions, and you are fan of monster movies, you will probably like this.	4.0	1
med_191060	Lois Lanes opening statements to the army staff.. something ABOUT DICKS,, makes it inappropriate for my children anyway. She was not the right actress for this movie,, bad casting over done fight scene in the end,, time killer obviously. All around lame movie for one of the best comic and series for family viewing in the past.	2.0	0

med_191065	Although there's a lot going on here, the wide sprawl of characters and situations not fully developed makes for a film that doesn't add up to much. The cast is very attractive but the script lets them down. It's no wonder this film sat on the shelf for over two years before being released A real let down.	2.0	0

med_191071	As others have said, very moving documentary about what our soldiers are going through overseas. 5 stars for the troops, minus one for the journalist narrative parts. While I appreciate the journalists going over to document some of what is happening, they should not be the main story. God bless our troops.	4.0	1
med_191072	Excellent series. Beautiful scenery. I loved the plots, so well thought out. The English accent makes each episode even more enjoyable. I enjoyed watching Vera very much.	5.0	1
med_191073	I would rather chew cut glass than sit through this film again. The characters lack enough intelligence (or common sense) and sufficient motivation to be realistic. I am a fan of Esai Morales, but his character is such a thug in this film, that it is impossible for me to like the movie.	2.0	0
med_191074	Real journalism supported and financed by real folks. It reveals the tactics and lies of others who have a major agenda. Excellent documentary - shunned by Hollywood which gives it 10 stars in my book. The real people here finally have a voice. Their lives have been impacted and this documentary speaks to them and gives them a vehicle to share their stories.	5.0	1

med_191082	Thank god I didn't pay for this. The script below average, characters meh, the plot so thin and transparent you can literally (pun intended) guess what's going to happen from scene to scene.

med_191090	If your household consists of adults who loved Shrek 1 and 2 don't buy this movie. If your household has young children go right ahead.

med_191094	Great Comic Book Fun! Was a fun, exciting ride through the Marvel Universe! Some typical violence you expect to see in a Comic Book Action Movie! Nothing over the top, or graphic, but some blood, and obvious death scenes? Perfect for kids over the age of 5 I would say, strong character developmental aspects, marginal story line, but the actors & their characters carry the film through the few moments of just wasted film? lol	4.0	1

med_191096	If you are expecting aliens and characters fighting for survival this is not your movie. The acting is excellent. Cinematography is excellent. Casting is excellent. Sound and music too. It is the story that brings the tower tumbling down. It is about the imperfect relationship between a guy and a girl and that is about it.	2.0	0

med_191098	I think this movie is beautifully directed and produced. In the end, the takeaway is (for me)...a life with no hope is no life at all. So let's have hope. My hope comes from The Lord, The Creator of me and you, God, Jesus Christ and The Holy Spirit. I'm not perfect in my walk with God but He perfectly walks with me. Thank You Lord.	4.0	1
med_191099	I love the Sex and the City series and was excited to get the collection. The collection arrived smelling like cigarettes and about 1/3 of the DVDs are scratched so I can't watch many of the episodes. A bit disappointing when the collection was marked as being in good condition.	2.0	0

med_191103	A great concept that gets so full of its mission to make a heady statement that it falls under its own weight. Nice effects and great acting by the kid. Just a dumb story (and I love science fiction) with little character development. Many of the weakness of Star Wars Episode 1. I have many DVDs in my collection, but his one will not .	2.0	0

med_191121	This had to be the most disappointing martial arts sequel I have ever seen. I had some high expectations, but I had seen Tony Jaa deliver in fight scenes in movies such as Ong Bak and the Protector 1. The fight scenes in this movie were so far inferior to the the first movie and his other works that I am at loss for words. I also had liked previous martial arts scenes from Jija Yanin but I was also disappointed with her fights in this movie, she was severely underutilized.	2.0	0

med_191128	"In the 70s, Disney made wonderfully adult movies such as this and ""The Watcher in the Woods"", with violence, suspense, and many other things not suitable for young children. Then, suddenly, they stopped, instead cranking out the same animated musical with different titles. Let's hope they go back to making movies like this. I mean, what other Disney movie features people BURNING IN HELL?! Now, THAT's not your usual Disney!"	4.0	1

med_191146	Didn't care for this movie very much. It was rater slow moving and so-so acting. Somewhat of a disappointment. I've certainly seen better Lynn Whitfield. This, in my opinion was a waste of her talent. Also, Patti LaBelle had very little to do.	2.0	0
med_191147	As someone obsessed with the Murder, She Wrote TV series, I was pleasantly surprised to discover this 4-movie collection.

med_191148	"This DVD boxset of ""It Takes a Thief"" is a swindle because the prints are raw and unrestored and it shows on the screen and there are no subtitles, no English subtitles.

med_191150	No question that Kevin Bacon gives an excellent performance in this film. That said, I have huge problems with the idea that a creep who has molested children can achieve redemption in any form. Just because he beats up a fellow predator and stops himself from raping another in his string of victims we should rally around Walter?? Forget that. No child molester deserves pity or forgiveness. I would much rather have seen him kill himself at the end of the movie like all pedophiles ought to do.	1.0	0
med_191152	Two people in one room for 25 minutes, good acting, good dialog, great show. I also like Nascar, the NFL, and the Olympics, winter and summer. Fringe, Continuum, and the original Day the Earth Stood Still are pretty good also.	5.0	1

There were suspenseful and scary moments in the movie but overall it was a mess."	2.0	0
med_191174	I am a huge Woody Harrelson fan and interested in anything and everything that deals with the LAPD. So naturally I was drawn to this movie. I heard many reviewers saying that Harrelson gave an Oscar-worthy performance, etc. I cannot describe how let down I was by this mess of a movie. Horrible direction, shoddy story, bad movie. Heck, I would recommend the very average Dark Blue before I would this movie. Not good.	1.0	0
med_191175	Hollywood takes an acceptable story,lengthens it,brutalizes it, convolutes it,then apparently asks DiCaprio to save the film for the viewing audience. Leo does his best with some realistic,mature acting, but this is not a movie that can be dominated by one man( a la Jason Bourne).If you're a DiCaprio fan, you'll probably enjoy his acting.

The plot sucked, had way too many inconsistent twists and turns and we finally just looked at each other and shut it off after T.I. yelled ""you crazy!!!"" After supposedly being shot in the foot!

med_191234	"One of the director's more surreal, experimental works, ""Persona"" is an intriguing study of mental illness, role reversal, and the somewhat hazy boundary separating one individual identity from another. In the poetic opening shots culled from old reels, Bergman makes us aware we are watching a film, but the story itself derives emotional intensity from Bibi Andersson's Alma, who becomes ever more vulnerable the deeper she plumbs her life experience. ""Persona"" is a spooky, mind-bending film that casts a unique spell."	5.0	1
med_191235	Historically inaccurate costuming. Wehrmacht (German Army) Lieutenant officers were not commanding the horrific death camps. SS uniform costumes for both Waffen-SS (grey) and Allgemeine-SS (black) uniforms grossly inaccurate. Weak plot, poor acting and pure fantasy B movie involving vampire characters. Unnecessary nudity and homosexual scenes. This film was bad enough as it was exploiting Nazi death camps in reminding us of the atrocities and utter genocide of the Jews. Enough is enough!	1.0	0

med_191266	I've always loved the Max Fletcher Superman Cartoons. Besides Disney, I think these are the standard by which all cartoons should follow. It's hard to believe these images were created in the 1940's. The detail is sharp and the stories reflect the innocent time in which they were made. The documentary on how these were made and the back story was good but I wanted to learn more about them (I'm a big cartoon buff).	5.0	1

med_191275	The show itself is not bad, there are some funny moments. Based on the show itself I might rate it a 3. The reason I gave it a 2 is because there are at least 4 seasons of this show and only season 1 is included in Prime. What good is it to watch a season, only to have to purchase the remaining seasons? I will check on any new shows that interest me, to make sure that all seasons are included in Prime. If not, I won't watch it.	2.0	0

All Cuba Gooding Jr., did was walk around with a pipe in his mouth. Terrence Howard wasn't much better. The movie was choppy and jumped around from one subject to another. I reccomend renting this movie before purchasing it to see how well you like it before adding it to your dvd collection.	2.0	0

med_191401	This movie surprised me with how good it was played out with only a female cast. The story involves husbands, mostly unfaithful, yet there is not one male in the film.

med_191409	I love horror movies as a rule. This was utter garbage. It is a cliche after a cliche after a cliche.

I would give it no stars if I could.	1.0	0

med_191423	I love the DVD. It's great to watch a fire since I don't have a fireplace. I wish that the image was further away at all times, however, my husband liked that it changed it up.

The show would never be able to overcome having him cast as captain. I like Bakula, but he was completely wrong for the part, and ruined whatever potential the show had. And then there was that opening theme. Horrible.	2.0	0

med_191450	I have def. seen worse but why did the director pick an insipid concept for a movie? Camp counsellors trapped in August of 1981 with slayings of innocent teenagers being repeated. Wow, that's really innovative. The black chick's dialogue was the only reasonable excuse for me watching the rest of the movie. **** SPOILER ***** And it turned out she was the only one who survived!	1.0	0

med_191452	The glimpses of fashion, vintage footage and great interview subjects are the most redeeming quality of this film. The filmmaker on the other hand is a poser desperately seeking to revive a 70's hedonistic fantasy. His doom was clinched when he was asked if he wanted to be taken through a collection and he declines, admitting he watches the models and not the brilliant works which adorn them. If you love fashion his ineptitude is an annoyance worth suffering to get a look into a great fashion icon.	2.0	0

Does not feel like you were forced to watch this in a Bible study or at church, legitimately interesting and keeps your focus the whole way through. Two thumbs up!	5.0	1

med_191489	This is a delightful movie which has both the uncut version to get so much more of the back story as the producers had in mind and the theatrical version which is substantially shorter (about 2 hours total). If you find Augustine's ideas interesting, like history, are Christian, or just want what I find to be an interesting movie, I would highly recommend it.	5.0	1
med_191490	Wow, it's so great to see this series on blu ray. The picture is great and it's widescreen. At the risk of dating myself, I remember watching The X Files on VHS tapes way back when. What a great show and it will always be one of my all-time favorites.	5.0	1

med_191500	This lovely black and white film with Ingrid Bergman, Charles Boyer, Joseph Cotten and if you'll notice a very young Angela Lansbury as their maid. It's suspenseful,exciting and filmed gorgeously. The tittle comes from the mysterious gas lights which keep dimming and lighting and mentally threaten Ingrid Bergman's character of a newlywed believing she's ready for a nervous breakdown. Very entertaining and doesn't lose it's magic after all these years.	5.0	1

med_191563	I saw this opening night and loved it. The humor was raw (not for the weak), suprising cameo's, and refreshing to see this finally come out. If you loved the first one SEE THIS!

Yes, she's cute, but she uses all of her ""aren't I cute"" poses too often. As well as using her ethnic-centered humor too often. It's funny at first, but gets very slow and boring."	2.0	0
med_191565	I never could like this movie despite all the hype around it, and despite the fact that I am an avid fan or romance movies.

med_191566	As the film formula generally goes, quality deteriorates through sequels. I don't think the Resident Evil series are mind-blowing, but I've always been entertained and engaged.

med_191590	The importance of Abdul Rahman's story goes far beyond the evils of the trans-Atlantic slave trade and plantation economy. The timing and context of his situation overlaps with major shifts related to class, economics, politics, diplomacy, immigration, repatriation, racial and social identity and the rise of tabloid media in our young nation.

med_191591	Overall, I was pretty pleased with this thriller. The plot moves a little slowly at times but it does build up to a big climatic ending.

med_191704	I thought it was in poor taste. Not even one belly laugh. This is not what Christmas is about for me and mine. I thought his long opening about his daughter's filling her gas tank, is not what I was paying for in a title Very Special Christmas Special !	2.0	0

med_191706	This is a sad but very beautiful story and animation. I first saw it on youtube and loved it so much that I decided to purchase the DVD.	5.0	1
med_191707	The movie itself is great. Absolutely amazing. The streaming through prime however, is terrible. Took almost 4 hours to watch a 2 hour movie thanks to Amazon stopping, buffering, restarting, turning off my player and then trying it all over again. Meanwhile netflix would stream fine and every other device in the house could connect to different apps and sites instantaneously(between efforts to try and watch the movie)	1.0	0

med_191709	"A really sappy movie with a pretty poor script. Obviously made by Wine Aficionados but wayyy to ""precious"". my guess is that Alan Rickman, Bill Pullman, et al were promised all the wine they could drink while working on the movie. Just a guess."	2.0	0
med_191710	This DVD is from 2003, although it's advertised as 2009. I thought it was a refresh of talking words, but it's the original one.	2.0	0
med_191711	A movie worth watching more than once. Classic JR story, interesting story line with classic characters throughout. Cruise great for character, but smaller than the book version.	5.0	1
med_191712	Hard to rate--can't stop watching, but every season has the same basic plot lines and action sequences, just different twists. In other words, by season 7 you know who is going to die, who is going to be rescued at the last minute, etc. Even so, it is a good action series I recommend for that genre watcher.	4.0	1
med_191713	Great fun movie for all viewers as it captures the brilliant British humor that has made the UK series such a big hit. The casts of the film were brilliant as they all had a complimentary role to the two leads; Steve Carell and Anne Hathaway. I would definitely recommend this film to all movie goers as it is jam packed with smart and sexy humor and comprises of some pretty cool action sequences but the comedy is the bread and butter of this film.	5.0	1
med_191715	This is a very good 3D movie and I recommend it to anyone who is shopping for 3D movies	4.0	1
med_191716	A good version that did no have the CG to make it look to farfetched.	4.0	1
med_191717	First, please save your money on this one, wait till it's in the 5 dollar bin at Wal-Mart. If you've seen the commercial you've seen the movie, the other hour and 58 minutes is filler. The ending is horrible. Not horrible in the Horror sense but in the terrible, no-good sense. The whole wolf thing, fake and unbelievable. Sorry Liam I was really hping for a great movie from you.	2.0	0
med_191719	"I watched about 10 minutes of this ""movie"", so I don't really know if I can call it crap. Maybe it got better. But those ten minutes were. I doubt if I could give this away and not have it returned next day."	1.0	0

med_191725	The actors were a big reason we chose this movie. The movie highlights a heartbreaking and very real problem in America and will hopefully open peoples eyes. I would have given 5 stars, but I thought it could have had a bit more suspense. I did believe that it ended with a note of the justice many of us want in these cases, but there again it left me wondering what happened to the rest of 'the ring'.	4.0	1

med_191733	I started viewing the Blu-ray release assuming that it would be better than previous iterations. I had to stop because the transfer was so poor that I am certain it was done more than 20 years ago... crushed blacks with no detail, excessive contrasts, low resolution, all hallmarks of earlier HD telecine work done for early DVD and broadcast release. I am returning it. This film deserves the best.	2.0	0
med_191734	Halloween resurrection rocks regardless of the bad reviews you've heard. some people make fun of halloween saying he got his head chopped off but it wasn't him and some r like man thats so stupid but jason in space yeah thats sheer genius! before the summer Halloween resurrection was in the boston herald in the top 20 most anticapated movies of 2002 do u see any jason movies being anticapated hell no! so in this genre the chair goes to the king micheal myers	4.0	1
med_191736	They hype made it sound like a dark thriller. Mathew M. sleeping with a 13 year old girl is flat out CREEPY! The story is boring, just avoid this, not worth your hour and a half of time, even if you are a MM fan.	1.0	0
med_191737	Really a good movie. It's has some people hating it but then we'll never mind. LOL! If you can watch a movie for it's value of being a movie which is entertaining and not just logic which some people just can't do leading them to hate the movie. If people said they figured it out right in the beginning then they never watched the movie to the end. Nothing leads you to the end story.	4.0	1
med_191738	"This is a lovely collection, and Doris Day is a timeless beauty! Some parts of ""April in Paris"" are not so clear, but this does detract from my overall viewing pleasure. I am very impressed with the Special Features, which include hours of vintage cartoons, Joe McDoakes comedic shorts, sports stunts, Hollywood bloopers, and radio shows (audio only). Very delightful!"	5.0	1

Trust me and skip this one.	1.0	0
med_191741	Beware of receiving a DEFECTIVE DVD set from Amazon. There was only the 2nd DVD in my case. The first DVD was missing along with the holder for it.

This is one of the best detective series ever produced so I was highly disappointed not to view it when I received it.	4.0	1

med_191745	"I guess I was looking for more of the ""Secret Life"" than Ben Stiller provided.

med_191755	Without giving away spoilers I will say that this is the dullest season of survivor I have seen and I have watched about 12 seasons.

med_191768	This is the work of Bill O' Reilly. Why are Christians surprised? After this some Christians will still support the work of this man. This was based on a best selling book. Wow.

med_191770	This pathetic attempt at a documentary is nothing more than a platform for John Borowski to lamely attempt to blame the heinous crimes of Albert Fish on God, the Bible and Christianity as a whole through the maniacal ramblings of Joe Coleman who obviously hates God and worships Albert Fish and anything else perverted and evil. The film itself has the overall flavor of a disjointed, poorly made first year film students work. A film student who should think about another profession. Very poor attempt.	1.0	0

med_191778	I thought this was an amazing show. My only reason for not giving it 5 stars was because they used one of the Jonas brothers as Marius. The other stars were incredible. And the surpise ending was fabulous. As far as the technical side of things, didn't have a problem at all.	4.0	1
med_191779	It's absolutely terrible. Why did I give it 2 stars instead of 1? Because it's not as bad as the book. At the very least, the relationship doesn't seem as abusive as in the books.	2.0	0
med_191780	This is a find film with absolutely no unexpected twists or turns. You could write the middle and ending within the first five minutes of the movie.	1.0	0
med_191781	I enjoyed this movie. I really don't know why people give it such a hard time. It's a character-study first and foremost. I don't think audiences are supposed to spend too much time on the murder-mystery aspect of it at all; it's more about female-male relationships, particularly the one budding between Malloy and Franny. I do think it needs to be watched more than once to be truly appreciated, but overall I enjoyed it.	4.0	1

med_191784	I purchased this DVD to help with some knee pain and it seems to be working. I think the key is to do the workout every other day as the DVD suggests.

med_191789	It's actually a warm hearted movie. Sure, it's got pitch black comedy, that centers around murder and inappropriate sex, but it's pretty charming.

Very bad movie, terrible amateur acting (I especially couldn't stand the acting of the actresses who play the mother and the daughter, to the point that I started to fast forward their scenes). It seems like a student project. One of the worst films I've seen in a long, long time.	1.0	0

med_191859	Awesome complete collection of the entire Sanford and Son series. All DVDs are contained within one small package, not in multiple packages as in the previous versions. I own each of the individual seasons on DVD and this set is much better quality than the individual season DVDs. For the price I paid, I couldn't be happier. This was a great purchase. You can't go wrong with this one. I saw the same item at Sam's Club for $ 30 more just last week.	5.0	1

med_191871	I couldn't finish this movie. Just awful overall. The leading actors are cute but have no chemistry between them. After so many bad juvenile choices the characters made throughout the story, I finally had enough and skipped to the very predictable ending. Even the ending was irritating.	1.0	0

med_191897	I really wanted to like this film. It has a really interesting premise, decent acting, and decent dialog. The problem was the puzzles. The top mathematical minds all in one room, and the puzzles they answer are puzzles my 6th grade math teacher gave us to keep us busy. Come on, guys. That was just lazy. As a result, I was rolling my eyes most of the time and wondering when the puzzles were going to get better. Not worth your time.	2.0	0

ANIMAL RIGHTS ADVOCATES ARE JUST A FRAUDULANT ORGINIZATION THAT TRIES TO MAKE US THINK THAT PUPPY MILLS ARE EVIL. THIS IS JUST A PROPAGANDA FILM FOR THE PUPPY MILL INDUSTRY.

med_191917	Very interesting to see so much of his life that I didn't know. That said, I didn't get the feeling that it was very incisive. Rather it was more like a very good educational video--one you might see as part of a class on cinema. Still, i very much enjoyed it.	4.0	1

med_191920	"First of all, there is no walking in this video, so to have ""Walk"" in the title is a bit misleading.

BS!	2.0	0
med_191962	Great picture quality, the editing is done well. No hyperactive quick cuts, and the sound is actually really good. You can hear the bass, and the rear speakers are used well when listening in surround sound. Really wish Death Magnetic the CD sounded this good.	5.0	1

med_191972	The story really kicks in once Theo/Turbo leaves the garden and hits the road. I actually thought this movie had more for adults than kids - some of the jokes/puns really go over a kid's head, but to an adult they're awesome. The real surprise for me was how good/addictive the soundtrack was (including a lesser-known song by the Jackson 5) - they stuck in my head, so much so I later downloaded some of the songs.	4.0	1

med_191976	This work is for an older audience but it was sweet and safe and hopeful. If you are an old fart male like I am, watch it with the girl you love. It's not a love story but at the end it kind of is. Your girl will think you are sensitive. Good luck.	4.0	1
med_191977	There are no defects in the workmanship of this product. Many of the older films made prior to DVD and enhanced sound systems, do not generate the quality sound that newer DVD's produce. I would gather that this is because the older films did not introduce the higher quality sound capabilities when they were made. Firefox is such an older movie.

med_191986	"The film presents several nude men swimming through a set meant to resemble ruins of Atlantis. The lighting is murky in the extreme, making it difficult to enjoy the one thing ""Boyfish"" has to offer, the beautiful bodies of the swimming men.

med_191988	Well, yes, the actors, sets, costumes and cinematography are very pretty, but the film bored me to tears. Showtime's Tudors moves along better and keeps the watcher more involved, with plenty of sexy stuff to boot.

med_191992	UPDATE: wrote the good review (10 minutes ago) while watching the first half of the movie, then half way through it started to skip, now it won't even play. So scratches or a midge a on disk, tries other DVDs in player and they work fine. Will be exchanging for new movie.

med_191997	Frankly, this movie sucks. There is no plot in the movie, terribly acted, contains horrible dialogue, and moves so slowly as you watch each character stare into space. I rather watch grass grow - better yet - I rather watch grass grow and then die - it would be a better use of my time. Anyone who likes this movie needs to have their head examined.	1.0	0
med_191998	Politically incorrect at almost every turn and a bit vulgar as well, but plenty of laughs if your expectations are reasonable. It was kind of retro, resembling some of the shows from the 60 and 70's that used models and miniature sets. Well done and good crafting, Hard to call this an action-comedy since it's models but that's pretty much what it is. Pretty entertaining if you have about 98 minutes to kill.	4.0	1

Some special effects seem very early Transformer like.	4.0	1

med_192035	"I bought this tape because I love my other Great Body workouts; the ""Step Aerobics/Low Impact Aerobics"", ""Dynamite Legs"", and ""Upper Body Beautiful"", but I have several other Great Body tapes that are definitely not great, and this one is one of them. Forget it."	1.0	0
med_192036	I'm not quite sure this movie has the weight of it's predecessor, though it carries over with the same general acting troupe. Somehow the same passion that was believable in the first film doesn't quite carry over in this one. Toby wasn't my favorite character the first time around and he still isn't. 'Alex and Leo' just has more heart and soul. Besides I miss Philippe.	4.0	1
med_192037	jessica lange won an oscar for this, proof positive that some years are so bereft of strong performances, they HAVE to give it to somebody. apart from that, this is a silly exercise in anti-government paranoia, with a wasted tommy lee jones and not much else.	2.0	0

med_192045	I loved the movie and the drama in the movie in Colombia about a girl who came to America. It has touched my heart and has been one of my favorite all time movies.

med_192070	Basically a wholesome movie about a satellite dish used to transmit pictures of Armstrongs moonwalk. Quirky small town residents give the film humor and character, as we watch the crew that operates the dish deal with technical problems and inclement weather. Very enjoyable.	4.0	1
med_192072	The most Wing Chun of any Ip Man movie. Really enjoyable fight sequences. Wing Chun practitioners will recognize most of the moves used in the fight choreography but will also question some of the moves, stances and postures that depart from Wing Chun principles. It's a movie not a training video and in that sense it captures the Art and Essence of Wing Chun well. I've been training in Wing Chun since 1985 and will always refer to him as Yip Man.	5.0	1
med_192073	I'm sure this is great, but I was never able to get it to play. I tried the computer, iPad, and Amazon TV with no luck no matter what I did. I haven't encountered this problem in the past, so it seems specific to this particular purchase to me, but I could be wrong.	1.0	0

med_192084	I don't believe that there can be any middle ground when it comes to opinions of Little Britain - either you will find it outrageous, shocking and incredibly funny or sick,degenerate and a total waste of time. I think it is incredible. If you aren't sure you would like this sterling example of British humor, then I suggest you buy the first episode and watch it. From then on it gets only better (or worse depending upon your point of view).	5.0	1

med_192102	This is a great older movie about a group of college students who reunite and spend the week together after one of their friends commits suicide. The music is great.

med_192235	This video is nothing but a long commercial for the movie. A long chunk of it isn't even VeggieTales -- it's footage of a real band with kids singing.

med_192244	Good story of 2 young women studying at a rabbinical college in Israel and their interactions with an older, very sick woman seeking forgiveness. Strange, offbeat drama and yet I was strangely absorbed into it. Language spoken is Hebrew, but with excellent English subtitles	4.0	1
med_192245	Actually kinda dumb. Seems like they were trying too hard to write a script but it was pretty poorly executed. The acting wasn't very good at all. I like most of the cast, and normally their movies are ok...but this was disappointing.	2.0	0
med_192246	I am a fan of Rent and have seen it on Broadway and own the movie. Filming a live show is tricky and this version filmed live on Broadway falls short of a pleasurable experience for the true devotee such as myself. The editing is choppy and it has such a flat feel throughout. The singers/actors are adequate on this DVD however it lacks the polish that it should be afforded. I would just buy the DVD of the movie.	2.0	0

med_192286	This movie is good for a couple of chuckles, that's it. The people who said they loved it and never laughed so hard have to be children,12 or under. If you just have to see this movie , rent it. I found it very disappointing, slightly funny, but that is it.	2.0	0

The way the actor develop each of the characters and the effects though out the movie are things that I definitely enjoy.

med_192288	I wish I had seen the one-star reviews before I ordered the streaming version of this beloved series--that's what I get for ordering through Fire TV rather than the website. I used to have the VHS version of Our Mutual Friend, so I know the series well. I don't understand cutting out Sloppy and Mrs. Higden.

med_192303	This is not about the show but the Blu-Rays. I ordered and received a copy and disk one was bad. The seller immediately took action to replace and the second set had the same defect.

med_192304	"Despite the fact that this is the widescreen ratio, beware: THIS DVD CROPS THE ORIGINAL FILM. Lion's Gate Home Video has apparently made a corporate decision to crop all widescreen films from their theatrical aspect ratios to the 1.78:1 ratio of 16:9 widescreen TVs. While this means a somewhat negligible picture loss for Saw II, which had an original aspect ratio of 1.85:1, it's still ""reformatting to fit your screen"" that should be warned of on the disc package and before the film itself."	2.0	0
med_192305	It seems this DVD not in widescreen? Come on Fox, get with the times. A lot of us now have widescreen TV's and hate to watch the game in a box.

med_192307	Although some people trying to over-exoticize (common for reviews on foreign movies and people who are wannabe movie critics) this flick or over-complicate its meaning, it's really just a poorly constructed, low budget production with almost not redeeming qualities.

med_192365	I am a producer and many other things and I love this character mostly because Kristen Bell nails it! The story line is good and intriguing, I also think the rest of the cast are amazing in their rolls as they are also believable. Great Job tot eh cast and crew! Scott Singer www. FFPandD.com	5.0	1
med_192366	I enjoyed this a lot. It captures the Austen world very well. It is easy to watch and is all in all delightful.	4.0	1
med_192367	Fast action, almost too fast; I do not know why directors now a days give us stars, a good story, action; then speed it up for a quick ending. Then over leaving us with what happened? do I recommend this movie -yes would I pay big money to see at a theater definitely not. I'll wait till it gets to amazon and rent it. My two cents.	4.0	1
med_192368	I had first gotten the opera taken from the Aspern Papers. As with most 'modern' operas, I didn't like it. I had no idea Lost Moment was the same story, but this is wonderfully done...dark, mysterious, and unusual. Love the sets and the noir lighting. Hayward and Cummings practically glow with intensity in their roles. Moorehead keeps us on tiptoe, expecting her to croak at any moment. Very, very tense.	4.0	1
med_192369	This is just a sales marketing tool for Youngliving multilevel down line. The 1st DVD was informative on their oils but the second DVD was just telling you what the first DVD was telling you. I think it should be advertised as a marketing tool. If you are in that company it would be a great tool for you.	2.0	0
med_192371	Very surprized to see so many 5 star ratings on this. I usually like story lines like this. And although the acting was fantastic, the movie itself was just plain stupid. It could have been done a lot better. Hubby said he would have rather sat through a Lifetime movie.... Now thats bad for him.	1.0	0
med_192372	"Campy as hell, acting is borderline comical at times, and this is definitely ""B"" movie fare on tv. But the plots are intriguing, even though far fetched, but the show is just plain fun to watch. That's it in a nutshell-just plain fun!"	4.0	1
med_192373	Predictable comedy... If you're not ready to explain the birds and the bees to your kids do not watch. A spoof is what a spoof is: wacky.	2.0	0

med_192380	love old movies-this starts with people glued to the radio as opposed to glued to their iPhones. Classic movie involving mystery and humor	5.0	1
med_192381	I bought this is as a beginner video. She does explain things well, but the cabaret dance is real cheesy, so I always fast forward through it. The production isn't the greatest either. A good way to watch this video once you have the basic moves is to put on real belly dancing music and mute the sound on the video. But overall still a very good beginner video to learn the basic moves. I think putting an actual dance together requires another video that I'm in search of.	4.0	1
med_192383	I like vampire movies. Great to Awful, I endure them all. 'Blood' doesn't make the 'Great' category, or even the 'Good' category, however it's not to bad to sneak downstairs and purloin the disc and pop it in to watch in darkness of the den/family room/wherever . . . what is that? A shadow in the corner of the room . . . yep . . . 'Blood' just might make you a bit jittery. BOO!	4.0	1

med_192387	This is a very exciting movie about man-eating lions terrorizing men trying to build a railroad bridge in Africa in the late 1800s. I originally had this on VHS then upgraded to DVD. My DVD disappeared, so I purchased the blu-ray version, because this is one movie we watch over and over again. I highly recommend Ghost and The Darkness. Great story and acting.	5.0	1
med_192388	"This is a 100% typical Hollywood scary movie and has almost the same technical structure as ""The House On Haunted Hill"". The only big difference besides the plot is that ""13 Ghosts"" has contents the more expensive visual effects and with Shannon Elizabeth something nice to be focused on..."	2.0	0

med_192392	This version of HxH is absolutely sensational, the remake is not any better than the old version, the episodes is not originally made in high definition by Nippon TV, yet the quality is still sharp! The dub is great, I just wish the remake would be dubbed too!	5.0	1
med_192393	nice to see action, without the potty mouth that goes with it. fun and clean, what more can you ask?	4.0	1
med_192394	This movie was absolutely terrible. The main characters in most horror movies are dumb, but these characters' stupidity is way beyond that, to the point that you will be [mad] through the whole movie, hoping that they'll just die soon and get it over with. This movie was definately a waste of 90 minutes.	1.0	0
med_192395	This DVD is jam-packed with beauty. I liked the fact that it contains three huge chapters, each presented on its own. The whole DVD is over 3 hours long but no time is wasted on irrelevant stuff. The photography is excellent. You can tell the author really respects the places visited. This DVD is great as reference material for old world Italian architecture. Panning views of buildings and streets are often shown.	5.0	1
med_192396	Too plodding. I did not feel any suspense because it was six shooters versus what? The troglodytes needed some advanced weapons.	2.0	0

med_192398	"It's possible that this was John Blushi's final movie... and if that's true, then this might have put him in a early grave. Tedious and decidedly un-funny, the film is too dense to ""camp"" and too earnest to be a rib tickler. That said, my boyfriend thinks it's funny and when you love someone, well, you make an effort to like what they like. He's worth it."	2.0	0

med_192400	"I have no military experience and I could tell this movie was far from reality. On top of that the dialogue was horrible, all the immature (and not funny) sexual jokes made me feel like I was listening to a bunch of 12 year old boys. That along with too many ""hoorahs"" made this movie a joke. It has a good message so I'll give it 2 stars instead of one."	2.0	0
med_192401	"I have not read the comic book but I hope it is as good as the movie makes it. When I first saw this it was on tv and I had the ""meh"" impression. But after owning it and being able to sit down and fully immerse myself in the story and characters I quite enjoy it."	5.0	1
med_192403	This release is horrible. It's just a straight copy from a VHS not a master tape. The sound quality is average and the picture quality is poor. Unless you're a desperate Beatles fanatic I'd suggest wait for an official DVD release (if ever) or rent a VHS copy from your local library and save the money.	1.0	0

med_192406	"Predictable. Director relies heavily on ""shock cuts"" you'll quickly learn to anticipate. Daniel Radcliffe maybe had 3-4 pages of dialog - - the rest of the time he's sneaking down hallways, peering around doors, creeping up stairs, looking in bedrooms, etc. If, like a toddler you enjoy being startled, this movie may have something for you. Otherwise you can maybe make better use of your time."	2.0	0

med_192408	Good acting, but its slow and boring plot with a really uninteresting and depressing ending. Not sure who this movie appeals to. Seems like its probably very accurate depiction of what the spy game is actually like.	2.0	0
med_192409	Can't go wrong here. Especially once Shannon D. left the show. It really picked up then. However, I think they could have done without the character Billie. The introduction of her and her sister almost made me stop watching.	5.0	1
med_192410	Our almost three year old was scared in parts of the movie. The book is his favorite, so we thought he would like the movie - as he LOVES videos. However, we stopped the movie just a little while in, and haven't shown it to him since.	2.0	0

med_192416	Excellently portrays the passion and conflict he experienced, as well as his deep love for his wife. Very interesting to witness reenactment of the conflicts within the cabinet and with him. The longer the show goes on though, I find myself liking him less and less. He was a diligent worker and thinker, but rigid in some ways that I found troublesome. One example was his unrelenting rejection of his son Charles. The acting is quite convincing and this is great entertainment.	2.0	0

med_192426	Classic Shaw Brothers goodness. It's not 5 Deadly Venoms or Crippled Avengers good, but plenty entertaining. It is the typical; conflict, exile, resolution scenario that many of these movies are known for. But, if you love Shaw Bros then this movie should easily make your list.	4.0	1

med_192432	I hate to rain on anyone's parade but I did not like this movie. For one thing there were all adult actors (no children) and this appeared to be just another college movie. One where even the teachers dressed casually. I did not even identify with the main character. The enjoyment of any movie is entirely subjective and I did not enjoy this despite the seventy percent that gave it a five star thumbs up.	1.0	0

med_192439	A nice series, nice boxed set, easy to get to each DVD; sometimes the sound drops out from one channel for a second or three or four; mom loves them; I think they are hokey, you would have to have a perfect memory to figure out some of the murders, they really come from left field...but they are still great fun	4.0	1
med_192440	My boys love Timmy Time because it is a different show than the typical animated cartoons they watch. Timmy and his friends are also mischievous and fun! In this DVD Timmy and the gang pretend to be pirates and my boys couldn't have been happier! It is a cute show with lessons of friendship, working together, and using your imagination!	4.0	1

med_192445	It was visually interesting which shows why it won only visual awards. The movie was void of any emotional content - flat and vacant - it was as if Mel Brooks (there were some groaners and silliness) and a German clockmaker collaborated.	2.0	0
med_192446	I would just like you all to know that I rented this from redbox for a dollar. I ended up spending 25$ on it... just so I could break it in half so no other human being would have to be subjected to such garbage. I feel as if I should be nominated for a nobel peace prize for my services to humanity through my actions. the worst thing about it is, I am 100% serious. do not view this or your eyes may go blind.	1.0	0
med_192447	I never saw this when it was first released and watched it for the first time last night. What a great low budget Sci-Fi film with great emotional development. I like how it left many questions unanswered. If you watch, watch all the way thru to the credits!	4.0	1
med_192448	I loved the book, but was disappointed to watch this movie. So many things are missed, cut or moved, that it is hard to follow the movie, unless you already know the story line beforehand. I would NOT RECOMMEND watching this movie, unless you already know the plot or have read the book. Personally, I found the book to be more enjoyable than watching the movie.	2.0	0

med_192476	I really like Rodney Yee's stuff. I find him to go easy on the woo-woo stuff, and good with instruction.

Hard to go really wrong with Rodney Yee	4.0	1

I got through an hour and seven minutes of it before I finally gave up. I will say one thing in its favour, though: the director's vision of a futuristic L.A. was really good. Avoid this trash. Like Total Recall, this is one sack of garbage you'll be glad you didn't see.	2.0	0

med_192482	This is one of the coolest cult flicks I have ever seen I rented it at my neighborhood video store and loved it and now I can finally own it on dvd.

med_192483	The picture on the front was misleading since this was a very very old black & white. It is a dozen or so episodes of an old TV show. We laughed hysterically because so much of it is sooo non-realistic and the situations are nothing our current Boy Scouts would/could ever get theirselves into. But, watching it in the context of pure entertainment and not a Scout lesson, then I'll give it 4 stars.	4.0	1

med_192488	This is what indie movies should be like. This movie is very edgy with some great directing. Reese Witherspoon dose a great job and nobody will look at her the same way again after her great performance. Kiefer Sutherland makes a lasting impression without an overkill in screen time and the story is exellent but very screwed up. A definate buy for anybody that enjoys a good quality moive that dose not depend on speicial effects.	4.0	1

med_192505	The entertainment value of this series made it worth the price. If you enjoy mystical action shows you'll probably like this one.

med_192640	In my opinion, the pilot of the Big C is one of the best first episodes of any television series ever. It pulls you into the series, as is intended, but also can stand alone as a wonderful half hour of television, with characters you know and care about by the end of the half hour. And that's not to mention the ability to elicit laughter and perhaps a tear or two during that same short time. I absolutely love it.	5.0	1
med_192641	Nicely done in some segments. A bit more sitting on a given subject than I would prefer, which tends to confine viewing to a limited activity.

med_192693	This is a great series seriously lessened by Sony Pictures neglecting to secure the rights to the original music on the series so instead it replaced the music with much newer and much more inappropriate music.

med_192696	I was very disappointed that the DVD is not widescreen although it claims to be. When I watch it on my widescreen TV I have two big bands on each side of the screen. However, the film and music are beautiful. I would give it five stars for the content. If you don't have a widescreen TV then I highly recommend it.	2.0	0

med_192702	What we have here is a beautifully made piece of Christian propaganda. Good photography. good performances. nice music and fine direction.

Kill Bill is not a remake, but it was inspired by this movie, and seeing this movie gives a different perspective on Kill Bill (the significance of the fight in snow, for instance). It is also a great movie in its own right, with some quite different plot twists to Kill Bill and some insights into Japanese history to boot. Highly recommended.	5.0	1

I've heard people say that the movie drags on at parts but i couldn't disagree more. There is an abundance of humor and some very emotional scenes as well as some great cinematography.

But when I saw the Titles A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court and A Tale of Two Cities, I was thinking Bing Crosby and Leslie Howard. These were TV episodes, and were not well done.

So I was hoping to see what different direction Dick Donner had planned. Apparently, it was different camera angles. The beginning is the same, the end is the same, there's details in the middle which are different, but add nothing new or worthwhile to the story. I wish I had rented it instead.	2.0	0

med_192809	It has always been my policy not to throw books or movies away; rather retain them for later use or to give away. This movie has challenged my policy.

med_192810	Although I am a fan of Omari Hardwick, the role of Malik just did not work. Henry Brown, as Moses, did an excellent job!

Madacy has a history of producing low-cost low-quality legacy DVD's, just look at other reviews of Madacy titles (check out Charlie Chaplin DVD's).	1.0	0
med_192859	I'm a fan of Rob Zombie, but this movie was pretty bad all around. The plot sounded interesting and had potential. It just seemed derailed by poor movie sets, random music in the soundtrack, and except for Meg Foster and the guy who played the older man, poor acting. Pretty boring and about as cheesy as a movie can get.	1.0	0
med_192860	Soap opera-esque, good cast, good acting, poor script, poor plot. Predictable. So many same scenes, same dialogues a shame, so much potential for a good story.	2.0	0
med_192861	Excellent DVD! It shows you nearly all of the Islands main attractions. Also, some of the lesser known attractions. For the price, it was a great value. Having been to the Island several times I brought the DVD to show friends. I'm always taking photos so the DVD was nice to fall back on. The memories of Oahu will last a lifetime with this DVD... Go ahead and make the purchase. You won't be disappointed. Aloha!	5.0	1
med_192862	movie drags on a bit, and you get a little tired of hearing robert baer (one of my heros) say martyr, but otherwise an EXCELLENT, unbiased look into the minds of radical islam. I wish every american was shown this video in high school so they would wake the hell up. Im waiting for the hidden cameras inside the uk mosques to come out on dvd.	5.0	1
med_192863	She taught me many years ago, when I read Fountainhead, that I couldn't be true to anything else until I was true to myself and to what I believed. She taught me that I would continue to learn and to realize that there was a lot more and to believe and to believe and to believe. A brilliant mind and courageous artist giver, Ayn Rand.	5.0	1

med_192869	I think Maru Surrat's actual innocence was irrelevant to me by the end of this film. What was relevant is why the attourney fought so hard for her. As humans, we have the ultimate control over our own emotions and prejudices. We can choose to react or to think. This film gives deep respect to the founders of the Constitution as well as shows the need we have for it. Excellent film.	5.0	1
med_192870	Ahhh! I can't get enough of this movie! I've seen it so many times and still enjoy it at every viewing! Who knew robots fighting monsters could be so entertaining?!! Hurry up w/the sequel Mr. Del Toro!!	5.0	1

med_192872	One of the most tear-jerking movies I've ever seen. It's definitely on the top of my favorite movies. Catherine Deneuve looks great and the music is hauntingly memorable. A masterpiece that deserves to be seen by everyone! This is the ultimate musical. The entire movie is sung all the way through like Evita and Jesus Christ Superstar. The vivid colors are spectacular. A must-see for film lovers.	5.0	1

med_192876	It is a great old movie but the disc I received was a terrible copy. I don't know what they used but it is not any where near the quality of the original movie that I have seen many times.

med_192881	I was quite excited to get this, since I was looking for a high quality copy of dominique moceanu's 1995 aa & ef routines. However, I was VERY disappointed to find that they CHANGED THE MUSIC to all of the floor routines featured on the tape! I suppose this was for copyright reasons, but I would not have bought it if i had known. Also, although all of dominiques routines are featured in the aa half of the tape, NONE of her ef routines were shown.	2.0	0

med_192885	"bought for ""the fog,"" which is a classic. terror train is one of those violent, ""halloween"" type of films that jamie lee curtis did. it's pretty good and representative of the style of horror movies at that time. ""candyman"" didn't make much sense to me. i don't think the name has anything to do with the story or character."	4.0	1
med_192886	While some of the movies are fun and nostalgic, the audio and video quality of most of them is terrible. I found myself giving up on several of the movies simply because the video was so dark that you couldn't see anything, and the audio quality was so poor you couldn't understand what the actors were saying. It's still a decent value for the money, but be prepared to discard a large proportion of the movies simply because they are barely watchable.	2.0	0

med_192892	Enjoyed watching each show. Entertaining and brought laughter. Would of enjoyed Season 2 DVD more, if shows were not interrupted by film maker's intermission between each showing. In Season 1 DVD each show was played back to back. When one show ended, the credits would play then, next show started. This Season 2 DVD is still pleasing and filled with past memory humor.	4.0	1
med_192893	Fantastic if you want to put all workouts together or just do one. It's quick, but effective and the people in the video make it easy to follow along. I like how one person always does the easiest modification and one person does the hardest so you know what to do at any level.	5.0	1

med_192903	I'm disappointed at this film. I thought it would be presenting real unbiased facts. I find it to be very subjective on issues that the country already know. The title is quite catchy. Will not recommend to watch, I feel it aims to influence not to inform (bec it's not neutral).	1.0	0

med_192918	A good movie I enjoyed watching. Not a major blockbuster. Excellent acting. It had a ring of truth being made in the northeast where going back half a century there were handicapped people put away for lack of knowledge into their conditions.

med_192921	It really lived up to it's name. It is truly the worst horror movie eve made. If that is what the director was aiming for then he hit it right on the head. No plot, bad acting, a little flesh, and absolutely no horror. What a waste of time.	1.0	0

med_192989	Guided and influenced by the large number of reviews and it's high rating, I was compelled to buy, not rent this movie. Truly a mistake. The script is derrivative, the plot loosely cobbled together and totally implausible. I will not discuss specifics because that would give this movie more time than it deserves. Suffice it to say that the only saving grace was the cast - I like each of them a great deal but this was a case of the sum of the parts being greater than the whole.	2.0	0

med_193025	This is without question the most godawful flick I have ever seen. Could not stay with it to the end. I found myself thinking that it must be some sort of campy put-on but even if it was it was just dreadful.	1.0	0
med_193026	Wow...Based on the reviews I thought this would be a good movie, perhaps a great movie. Folks it isn't. It's like taking a trip to the dump, garbage in every direction. Unbelievably gross and repugnant human beings. Foul language abounds as do hateful people without morals or values. I didn't even make it to the half-way point of this film yet the extreme bad vibrations stayed with me for a good long while afterwards. Do yourself a favor, stay away from this cesspool.	1.0	0
med_193027	I remember watching this when I was pre-teen or a little older. It left a impact on my life for God and Jesus. I am now 62 and have been a Christian for 43 years. I am hoping this will impact my grand-kids, and leave them with a softened heart toward the Lord, as it did mine. I purchased two for Christmas presents. Hopefully the whole family will watch them. this is the best of the best!!!	5.0	1

med_193029	Interesting and thought-provoking for sure. In [very] brief, it questions the nature of man and an alien's attempt to fit in. But slooooowwwww. Scarlett is marvelous to watch, but in what feels like slo-mo for most of time, even she becomes tiresome. Which is sad because she is fabulous in her natural presentation of herself.	2.0	0

med_193031	I gave this so-called tv/trash/movie 15 minutes only because of Eric Roberts playing the devil. Which he did deliciously well. However it was not enough to keep my brain cells from melting over the terrible acting, ridiculous dialogue & misogynistic directing. The 2 stars were for Eric Roberts still looking good. Don't waste your time on this 'festern'...	2.0	0

med_193044	"Hollywood's ""Twelve Angry Men"" was about justice. It is a very fine film, a true classic. ""12"" is about mercy. It soars as high above ""Twelve Angry Men"" as mercy does justice. If you don't get this point, you won't understand its powerful message. Man's justice? Christ's mercy. I am so thrilled to see Russian film makers reclaim the heritage of their great literature (Dostoyevsky). Bravo!"	5.0	1

med_193046	so it locked up 3 times in the first 5 minutes so I bought Christmas with the kranks and it worked fine! So I know it wasn't me or the computer but the sad part was that shortly after watching Christmas with the Kracks we lost power here for 2 and 1/2 days so I paid for this movie and didn't get to see it! bummer, love tim Allen movies!	2.0	0
med_193047	Cannot rate this product because I went out of town before it was scheduled to arrive, asked my neighbors to keep an eye out for it, but the product was never received and I'm not sure I have a valid case for recovery because I was gone four weeks. I'm going to try to contact someone at Amazon for some satisfaction.	1.0	0
med_193048	Usually, a mystery has someone behind the scenes that knows the whole plot and is taking steps to keep the mystery a mystery - this does not. The title is a good one, because the entire movie is about shifting paradigms and those who are left behind when the rules change. I thought that the acting was good, and particularly admired the way direction was handled in the difficult challenge of bringing a book to the big screen.	4.0	1
med_193050	Love e show. First found on the Syfy Channel. What I didn't know is Syfy mixed parts of Season 1 & 2 to look as one season. Thanks for nothing Syfy. But, Plan to get all three seasons eventually anyway (1 and 3 yet to purchase because I thought I'd seen Season 1, but the mix of the Syfy Channel, Must go back first to see what I 'missed' that is caught up in Season 2, missing episodes, if you will. Then Season 3.	4.0	1

med_193052	"Based on an excellent short story, this one gets the Raspberry Award for worst adaptation. Matheson has been incredibly lucky over the years in that he has inspired some amazing adaptations . . . which, in my opinion, points to the strength of the source material. I went in with high hopes with ""The Box"" given the strong cast, but this one is a Class-A stinker, something way less than the sum of its parts. It's unfortunate."	2.0	0

med_193078	Not what I expected from this comedian. While there were a few funny points, he went on a rant about Wal-Mart: its merchandise, its greeters, its customers. It was when he went off about how the customers are beer-bellied, redneck, trailer trash that I had enough. I got rid of the dvd the next day; don't even want it in my house. There was very little funny here and certainly nothing Christian about this comedy routine.	1.0	0
med_193079	A little cheesy for my taste, but good to add to my James Bond collection of viewing material.

See if you can catch the cameos of other famous British actors in this film.	4.0	1

med_193089	Emma is a terrible matchmaker. Using social class instead of true interest and likes she is always making errors of judgement with regards to affairs of the heart.

med_193109	A very interesting show on automotive technology for the future. Some very good segments on battery, hydrogen, and diesel fuels. There are a few segments that discuss technology that could never exist, in particular is a narration on air powered cars (ep 5). The narrator flat out says that a compressed air driven car could recharge it self and provide perpetual motion. Science shows should be vetted by at least a high school science teacher. Very disappointing for such a otherwise well done show.	2.0	0
med_193111	Le Carre's Karla trilogy is the peak of spy thrillers and the 1970s BBC adaptations were rolled gold entertainment. This is nowhere near as good. The cast and script are shallow and the whole production has a thinness about it. Brian Cox is particularly poor- but the script kills him. The lead actor pretty boy is ALWAYS smoking - very irritating too watch. It gains a certain watchability momentum an hour or so from the end, but it's certainly not a repeat viewing DVD. Must watch Tinker Tailor again soon.	2.0	0

med_193195	We have been really into Battlestar Galactica, until the president decided it was more important to make sure every woman gave birth when pregnant rather than keep abortion legal. The lack of imagination in the writing was so disappointing.

med_193197	"I just got done watching ""Love Actually,"" it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. I was utterly disgusted! It made a total mockery of Christmas, with its ambiguous message--there was way too much sex and lasciviousness involved with the holiday celebrations. (Who in their right mind, dresses their kid up in some ridiculous lobster costume for the nativity scene?) It was blasephemous, vulgar, and completely gratuitous."	1.0	0
med_193198	"In my opinion, this movie was extremely well done. The director chose to let words, pictures, and facial expressions tell the story without adding any commentary, just a few facts that flash on the screen periodically. Are there villians? Certainly. Will you feel disgusted? Yes. In the end, you may find yourself arguing, ""Well, at least these girls are protected here, in the United States we do not exploit our own for entertainment."" Really? Think about it. Masterfully done."	4.0	1
med_193199	This is the greatest surprise I've found since becoming a Prime member. These stories generally follow the books and shorts written by Doyle, with a modern twist that brings the art of deduction into the 21st century. I cannot wait for season three.	5.0	1

med_193224	Very well acted & a nice period piece. My only complaint had to do with Julian Fellowes introduction and summary at the start and end of each episode.

med_193225	Meh, I saw it in the theater and didn't care for this version. It looks like the old Japanese fat version, that you could tell was a man in a costume. It did not look or move as realistically as the one in the 1998 Godzilla movie. For those Godzilla fans who loved the old style stomp out Tokyo and fake flames version, I'm sure this comes as a treat!

med_193360	The last thing I would want my body to look like is Phadraes -- back fat, huge thighs, tiny boobs.... and the photo on the DVD doesn't even look like her body. Can you say photoshop? I would by Kendra's crap either. Yes, she has a nicer body, but I don't want a huge ass like hers.	1.0	0
med_193361	One of the great classics of all time. John Wayne & Ben Johnson at their best.	5.0	1
med_193362	"I feel like this season had too many ""cheap shots"" and cliches. Characters and situations appeared out of nowhere and not enough time/effort was placed in their development. I had to force myself to watch the entire thing. Don't get me wrong, I am a HUGE fan of Downton Abbey and I know how hard it is to keep multiple stories going, but since Matthew and Sybil's deaths the writing/concept has gone downhill. I hope season 5 gets back on artistic track!"	2.0	0
med_193365	I just bought Sofia the First: Once Upon a Princess. I have not seen this one yet. I was introduced to Sofia by my 4 year old granddaughter. She can't get enough of Sofia. Is a huge fan. She knows the songs by heart, and even twirls around like Sofia. The storyline is such a great teaching tool to show kindness, generosity, thoughtfulness,you can do anything you put your mind to . For parents and grandparents alike you can't go wrong owning everything Sofia.	5.0	1

med_193370	I could not believe all the stupid commercials prior to the beginning of this film. And to add multiple commercials of up and coming Barbie movies was too much. I object to such asinine commercials that have no reference to the genre of the movie being seen. Please NO BARBIE MOVIE COMMERCIALS!!	2.0	0
med_193371	One of the worst movies that I have ever seen. I played it for my 12 year old son. Incredibly cheesy. No action. Horrible dialogue. We had to turn it off 40 minutes into because it was that painful. The director had to try to make a movie that bad. It could not have happened on it's own volition.	1.0	0
med_193372	I knew this Novela would be chopped up, but not like this. They left a lot of stuff that was not necessary and deleted some very important scenes. It seems like they added a lot in the beginning, then heavily edited at the end of the Novela. What also angered me is that the last disc is also double sided, but only one has video. Why use a double sided DVD and only use one side when there is at least 2 more hours of story line they could of added?	2.0	0
med_193373	Very old movie and its not a sequel to the evil dead movie of now days this is an old sequel to the first evil dead mayed. To me the movie sucked but if you like realy old horror movies then get it but it sucked to me.	1.0	0
med_193375	A curiously creepy movie with a clunky script and a ridiculous pairing of Grant and Loren. But worse than the script was the lighting and make-up, which makes Loren and Grant look cadaverous and in some scenes downright frightening. Both stars must have been in it strictly for the money. A young Paul Peterson (Donna Reed Show, etc.) plays one of Grant's kids.	2.0	0
med_193377	I run into this movie at Amazon by accident and decided to start watching it while doing the dishes. One hour and a half later the dishes were untouched. This movie will embrace you and not let you go for its entire duration. Once its over, you will feel surprised to realize it will stay in your heart for much longer. Watch it if you love real movies and appreciate raw acting.	5.0	1

med_193381	I am still baffled and amazed at how much content made it into the movie when the Hobbit was just a novella. The visual effects are fantastic. Go New Zealand! If ever there was a travel and tourism movie, I think the LoTR and the Hobbit have done it.	5.0	1
med_193382	"Owning this video myself, I want to say that this is an excellent title, but then I'd only be saying that to make myself feel better. While it's not the worst cartoon I've ever seen, it is the worst episode in my opinion. Of course, this could just be that I don't like the ""Ride of the Valkyries"" song. I like valkyries, just not the song. Anyway, rent it if you can before considering purchase."	2.0	0

med_193384	"I have to agree that Paramount is not doing a good job with securing music rights. The episode, ""Gloria Moves In"" was one of the ones where Felix starts singing and the rest of the group joins in. It's funny, but it is cut. Very obvious. I also much rather prefer they leave the original Paramount Logo at the end with ""A Gulf & Western Company."" I don't need to be reminded that its now CBS/Paramount."	2.0	0
med_193385	I've only watched the first episode so far, but I'm not captivated. I'm not sure if I want to watch more episodes to see if it gets better. More than anything, it's the main character who bothers me. He isn't quite silly enough to seem like a caricature, but you can't quite believe he's real either.	2.0	0
med_193387	I have watched seasons 1 through 4 and can't believe how real to life they are. This was a great series. It is really great to be able to watch this uninterrupted by commercials.	5.0	1
med_193388	Watched the first episode. Seemed to have flashes of odious scenes just for the sake of shocking the viewer. Perhaps a good depiction of what a traveling carnival would be like at the time, however too over the top for me. Later episodes may get better; I won't be finding out.	2.0	0

med_193396	As a 38 year old mother with 2 young girls (ages 5 & 7) I am used to repeatedly watching movies over and over and over...but this is one I do not tire of! The songs are great and extremely catchy, the dialogue is fantastic with many great one liners! I have to say, that my favorite characters are Mama Odie and Ray. Both have great lines and LOTS of character! This is a definite keeper!	5.0	1
med_193397	Part 1 was about in sync with the Saw movies, then part 2 came out & that movie really wasn't that great. Now with part 3, this one is much worse than the Saw movies, and too disturbing for me. I'm not really sure about all the violence & gore, yet this movie might be suitable for some people, it was not a hit with me. Beware if you have a sensitive stomach!	2.0	0
med_193398	I was introduced to Horrible Histories by songs on YouTube, and I wasn't sure when I bought this if the skits could be as good as I was expecting.

med_193400	This is pal version, so if someone have a multi regional DVD player, anyone can see the films, I recall these cartoons, when i was a kid, I love Spiderman and his amazing friends, even if the series didn't play longer than other cartoons, this is still good	4.0	1

med_193403	Saying that this movie is bad would be an understatement. This movie is truly terrible. Bad acting. Bad script. Boring. Bad directing. Bad editing. It sucks.	1.0	0
med_193406	So, we watched this as a family. Did it call to mind the cthonian richness of Fellini or the blue-gray, icy depths and intensities of Bergman? No. Did it entertain our whole family? Yup. Great for those of us who grew up on syndicated Brady Bunch episodes. Great for our kids, who binge-watched the Brady Bunch years ago. In fact, I would go so far as to say we had a peachy-keen, neato evening!	5.0	1

med_193410	Be warned, this is the DVD set, NOT the Box set! It's the same dvds but it's in a standard DVD case. The box set is in a much nicer box that folds out. It's not a big deal if you just want to own the series but I have the actual box set for volume 1 and was hoping for a matching box for 2. Now it looks pretty awful on my shelf	2.0	0
med_193411	This movie is alright, but I wouldn't pay $17.98 for it. It's confusing and the acting is bad, which is somewhat on par for a Fulci film. Unforunately, there isn't enough gore to offset these factors. I got it in the Horror Rises from the Grave set w/ 3 other movies for $7. It's worth seeing, but the only really memorable scene is the ver first one.	2.0	0
med_193412	I choose this rating because they have the right actors for the right part. Mix the right actors with the best scripts and you have the one of the best shows on the air. I saw the first break out show and then forgot about the show. Not that the first did not sell the show for me to watch just had to much going on. Started watching in season two and now i can not get enough. Thanks for producing something to nice to watch. Lady Dawn	5.0	1

med_193453	This is why i am not a fan of Marvel movies. Simply because hollywood always find a way to destroy a perfectly good comic. I would not recommend this to anyone.

med_193454	I have to wonder why one would make a movie about the man who shot John Lennon. Seriously. Who cares about this piece of crap? But, I gave it a shot hoping to see a good performance from Leto. What a horrible movie. Completely unwatchable. The thing I kept asking myself, before hitting fastforward was, 'Why SHOULD I care?'

med_193499	The story is a little different from your standard kung fu films. The minimally erotic content was kind of a nice change too, as you don't see that in most kung fu films. My only complaint about the film is that some of the battle sequences, they reduced the frame rate, which lessens the intensity of the combat. (Brigitte) Lin Ching Hsia is a great action actress as usual. If you like her films, you won't be disappointed.	4.0	1

So if you are looking for a historically accurate movie, this is not the one to pick.	1.0	0

med_193523	The Lethal Weapon movies may have been appealing to action fans many years ago, but honestly, look at them. Do you think they aged well? I don't. They are SO cheesy that it makes my head hurt watching them. They are sort of overrated too. Even back in the day they were overrated. Well, if you like action films, this may or may not be worth investing.	2.0	0

med_193528	21 Jump Street is a funny, entertaining film. The two main characters, played well by Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum, are two inept police officers who are sent undercover back to high school (much the basic premise of the original television show). The pair has difficulty fitting back in, but through comedic adventures and high-octane action, they uncover the drug ring and ultimately have success.	4.0	1
med_193529	I thought this was going to be a good movie and while it does have it's moments, it's just alright. Besides I have seen this type of movie before (Netherbeast Inc. 2007), so it's not new. I just thought that maybe the humor would be good and while it did make me laugh a few times, it was slow. I think I set my expectations too high for this movie but it did show a lot of promise, someone really dropped the ball on this one.	2.0	0

It's nice to see the stars getting together to do something positive like this. Highly recommended.	4.0	1

Very interesting to think about decisions that were made ahead of time that lead to their predicament. Riveting movie none the less. Tom Hanks was great as usual.	4.0	1

med_193680	What a horrible sequal. A hollywood blunder, bad acting, bad plot, no movement. Just Bad! Most of the actors phoned this one in. They should have put nicholas cage in there too. Choko, from Domino, was a horrible choice for Aries. It lacked too much to list. And Kronos, what was that. what about the other titans.	1.0	0

med_193686	"Highlander was a 4-star borderline B movie but still one of my favorites. Highlander II, not matter how they re-work it to ""fix"" the plot problems from the original theatrical release is a 1-star C grade movie. Avoid...it goes against the Highlander canon. Of course, if there can be only one...how come there were 4 sequels. I know...to milk the franchise."	1.0	0

Plus John Stamos looks so cute!"	5.0	1
med_193700	I liked this movie and my partner thought it was ok. This movie uses flashbacks, symbolism, and some flashes forward. If you pay attention it all comes together in the end. It may not be the perfect ending for some viewers but it was definitely the perfect ending for the character.	4.0	1

This DVD is great for people who love to stay limber, and rather stretch in the comfort of their own homes!	5.0	1
med_193703	It's not what I expected but in many ways better, it can be a little confusing at first but it all makes sense after a couple of episodes. What more surprising is that it's from the creator of glee which is totally the opposite of this show in terms of genre and plot but same type of humor at times. The actors are great to pull this off convincingly.	4.0	1

The movie itself is boring and goes absolutely nowhere. I agree with one other review here when the said ""I just didn't get it."" What was the purpose? I kept thinking it was going to get better and then it just ends...sometimes Once it too much."	2.0	0

med_193755	The movie has a disconnected, difficult to follow beginning, but redeems itself somewhat with a plausible second half. Certainly not one of Ben Stiller's best performances even as an occasional character. Winona Ryder is the real star as she juggles her first apartment with joblessness, unhappy room mates and 2 lovers who seem to perform their best when antagonizing each other. All said, the movie was a great disappointment.	2.0	0

med_193778	I couldn't get through this movie, and I like strange movies. I actually enjoyed The Science of Sleep for it's quirky, dreamy stop motion stuff, because it seemed appropriate for the context and the character.

med_193875	This movie starts brilliantly. It weaves the previous movie together in an entertaining and wondrous way. It kicks off the new timeline and story line in an engaging way. And then they unveil the antagonist... and the movie crumbles. Horribly. The only two things that kept me watching were Emilia Clark and J.K. Simmons. Arnold was good but he's playing a terminator so no real surprises in his performance. This movie could have been spectacular but comes it at merely meh.	2.0	0

med_193886	I like John Waters movies but this one just doesn't work for me. Kathleen Turner does an amusing over-the-top June Cleever when she's not in crazy-murderer mode.

med_193930	The good thing I can say about the movie is that I laughed once or twice. Ok, now on to the bad things. The plot was shaky at best. The forced humor often missed and was not funny.

Then there was the EXCESSIVE language. Ugh. NOTE TO PARENTS: Don't let your kids watch this. Period.	2.0	0

This movie is bad at all levels. I am shocked Nancy Wilson was somehow involved in it. I love old Heart music. Most annoying things: Jason Lee's nosejob seems to have been performed by a blind person and Kate Hudson has no upper lip. I wonder if all the 5-star reviews are just sarcastic.	1.0	0

The acting was mediocre, the jump scares were predictable, the whole movie was unnecessary. You would be better to re-watch the first one than to rent this.	2.0	0
med_194041	he exciting stories of Batman (voiced by same actor across the major animated DC series --- love the consistency) told with great art, stories, and voice actors.

med_194047	very well made and stunning shots! We found it to be a bit short compared to many of the larger blockbuster movies nowadays, but we really liked it - we just wish that Amazon had a 'second rental option' where you could rent it again for a lower price - its hard to hit that 48 hour window sometimes on a busy weekend, but we'd really love to have a lower price for a second or third rental!	4.0	1

med_194050	Just when I thought Martial Arts couldn't get any better, Jet Li shows just how wrong I was. He exudes an unmatched passion for Martial Arts and it is evident throughout Fearless. His acting improves with each film and this one is no different. I have every movie that Jet-Li has made and if you're a fan, you won't want to miss adding Fearless to your collection.	5.0	1

The thought of someone or something underneath, or in this case ""following"" you, rings true. While the threat seems silly in your mind, the notion that maybe, just maybe, there's a steady, stalking evil at your heels gives this retro feeling newbie a full 5 stars."	5.0	1

med_194056	John Malkovich and Glenn Close are awesome. The plot focuses on the interaction of the characters and their desire to show personal control and power over themselves and others. The 18th century aristocrat setting supplements the inter-personal relationships. The movie was redone with a modern day scenario in the film 'Cruel Intentions'. I enjoyed the comparison although 'Dangerous Liaisons' is definitely tops.	5.0	1
med_194058	First of all my husband an I love the show so i would give 5 stars to the show however we were very disappointed when we were watching the alias season 4 and got to the last disc an it wouldn't play at all..

med_194070	This movie was a piece of junk! If people think this is good they haven't seen a good romantic movie in a LOOONG time! As if his employer's daughter and wife wanting to sleep with him wasn't bad enough then the employer tries to seduce him. Oh yeah, did I mention the dog?! If that's the best premise for a romantic comedy this writer could come up with I'm pretty sure Academy Awards won't be lining his shelves! Don't waste your time OR money!	2.0	0
med_194071	It is a shame that a movie has to be made about the most terrible crime in the world and that is the overwhelming increase of human trafficking among our very young children to sell them all over the world just to exploit them sexually to those that are willing to pay a high price for them. Unfortunately a true story that happens way too often. The quality of the audio and video was good with no buffering interruptions.	4.0	1

med_194080	I'm pretty sure Halloween 6 had been the only one in the series I hadn't seen so watched it and I have to say I think it's absolute rubbish. The storyline, the acting (Donald Pleasence clearly on his last legs, sadly) even the kills.	2.0	0
med_194081	This movie is one of my all time favorites. However, this copy is very poor quality, and is even missing scenes from the original movie. It looks like it was recorded off of a TV. Do not buy this copy. It does not do the movie justice.	1.0	0

med_194083	I felt like this series tried to be a cross between Mad Men and Masters of Sex, but with terrible characters. I really disliked the main character - a slimy married doctor who's obsessed with a new nurse - and didn't care for any of the female characters either. I can honestly say this is the first Masterpiece Mystery I haven't liked. Didn't keep watching, and read it wasn't renewed for a second season, that's not surprising.	2.0	0

med_194090	I give this DVD 1 star not because of the movie quality but because the DVD version, as opposed to the Video, does not have Harrison Fords Narrative thoughts and comments. As a result there are lots of long camera shots pointed at his face. Without the narration of what he's thinking, these long camera shots and musical breaks seem a bit silly. Until they remaster this DVD I would not recommend the purchase of it.	1.0	0

med_194117	In my book, nothing featuring Walter Matthau could rate lower than four stars: he elevated everything he was ever in. If anyone still remembers Clifford Odets, it's probably due to this play. I agree with others that the pacing is sluggish and Odets's work does not wear as well as, say, O'Neil's. That said, when Matthau is onscreen, especially in dialogue with Felicia Farr, there's snap and crackle. Overall: a three-star production with a five-star cast.	4.0	1
med_194119	The production is very poor, the music (in the first section) too loud. The second section is a repeat of the first. It also contains a break where Sam's young daughter takes over the narrative, babbling in her two-year way. Sam has abandoned the camera, which is allowed to run unattended, to answer someone's off-screen questions. If you wish to learn Shogi, seek out Hidetchi's videos on YouTube---they are wonderfully instructive.	1.0	0

med_194137	I was very pleasantly surprised at how good this was. The analysis was outstanding and insightful.

med_194144	I think this movie came about in that time when 300 was such a success and all the movies about ancient gods came back. This movie is nothing like those movies. This movie sucked. The preview makes it look good but its horrible. Had very little exotic and enticing ritual scenes, very little back story. Pretty much them running from the beast in the crude caves being killed. dumb. The King was just an awful actor and you just felt creeped out by him. Overall a fail. Skip this film	2.0	0

med_194147	Started out sort of strange. I wasn't sure I would watch it all. At first it seemed to me confused as to what kind of movie they were making. There was one point though in the middle, where I really got involved with the movie and the characters. It turned out to be a really good movie. The last half ( three quarters?) made it worthwhile for me. Evan Rachel Wood was absolutely outstanding.	4.0	1
med_194148	This was an intriguing movie. The sex is more implied than graphic, thereby the R rating. Story itself is predictable, although the minimum number of characters make the story more interesting. Widescreen edition is best for your large screen tv.	2.0	0

The house on the fog shrouded moors was clearly spooky and I was glad to see the actor who played the Wildling king on Game of Thrones lending some much needed support. Mr Radcliffe has clearly evolved out of his Harry Potter days as a good actor. By the way watch out for those evil doll things in the playroom!	4.0	1

med_194162	This film wants to be too many things at once, preposterous art house flick, horror film, and porn film but in the end, it turns out to be stupid and quite boring. The premise is that a child, with disturbing qualities, namely a shyness that is so terrifying, and an excessive imagination. There is absolutely nothing in this film that qualifies it as a horror flick so I suggest people ignorning it. A big waste of time.	1.0	0

med_194204	I also bought Ball Sculpt with Kira Langolf and love this one as much as that one! There are so many great ab exercises that I was sore from this one too, for a few days. I really need abs and this is the perfect workout for that!	5.0	1
med_194205	Alternates between boring and exasperating. These 85 minutes aren't worth one second of any Tarkovsky film.	1.0	0
med_194206	I Thought Radcliffe did a fine job with the material they gave him. The others were good enough. Just thought the story lacked scope. Had the focus been more on Ginsberg's genius, rather than just his attraction to Carr...but then that wouldn't have fit the little narrative arch the writer was going for, I guess. Still, not a waste of time.	2.0	0
med_194207	Yet, ANOTHER CURE FOR CANCER that's been hidden for many years. We've spent over 39 BILLION on cancer research which has all been a joke. Watch this and learn the truth about how this cure got buried.	5.0	1
med_194208	Interesting plots and story line, decent acting, usually not overdone with extended scenes of blowing things up beyond necessary for the story. Good mix of main actors, characters.	4.0	1
med_194210	This movie is one to win hearts. The premise is that of a woman leaving a message to her true love and then never hearing back from him only to have a young woman discover her message decades later and decide to play cupid to this now aging grandmother. A search, 2nd chances for old love and a hint of new love come together and make this a feel good movie.	4.0	1

med_194217	This movie is such garbage ! Bad CGI, bad acting, plot holes galore ! After being raised by a nurturing human this ape turns against mankind because of a couple of humans were mean to him. I don't buy the character's motivation. The CGI apes look fake and James Franco's acting is horrendous. The Whole movie feels like it was rushed !	1.0	0
med_194218	This movie is great, as long as your not taking it word by word. As far as mystery it has it, Ancient Egypt is something a lot of the world is fascinated by. Though as far as facts this movie lacks (reason for 4 stars) Seti I was not the richest pharaoh, Imopteh was a high priest, Ankhesenamon was the wife of King Tut. I get kind of sick of people thinking that the people's stories were facts. Seperate fiction from fact please.	4.0	1

med_194223	We were both extremely disappointed with this movie. We are offshore sailors and were really looking forward to this film. It was so boring! Those type of emergencies at sea would have alisited way more response than Redford showed. He would have been way more a excited and talking himself through the events. Very poor showing.	1.0	0

med_194227	Took me a while to get into this movie, though worth it. The portrayal of a 70-something widower acting on his true self is a bold statement. Not my reality, but well acted and include a bittersweet heterosexual romance.	5.0	1
med_194229	I thought the world couldn't take another small town grieving brooding silent resentments I hate this place story. The 3 men in this film are so withdrawn it takes almost the whole movie for them to seem like real people. But Kristen Stewart as the young crippled girl eventually steals every scene. I expected her to overact just that fatal millimeter or have lines that manipulated or preached at the audience, but she never did. Well done.	4.0	1

med_194238	I agree with Mel Torme, just a horrible movie. It's as if the idea is to irritate and agitate the audience as much as possible. None of the characters are likable. The soundtrack alone made me want to hunt down Mr. Anderson and beat him to death.	1.0	0

med_194244	THE HD wasn't very good...several times...like 35% of the time...the clarity of the image was horrible (out of the 4 bars it stayed at 2 most of the time).

med_194259	"This movie was VERY well done- a great movie all in all- although having read the book it is a little disappointing in that some very key parts are left out. To make ""The Mists of Avalon"" into a movie and to really DO it right would have taken a lot more time, and the movie would have been about twice, maybe three times as long. So as it is and for what it is, I give it thumbs up."	4.0	1

med_194272	Not only does Hollywood have no more new ideas, but the ones they come up with are just trash! I cannot believe that anyone would really like this movie, and I must not be alone because it was not released to the masses! This is border line brain washing. It is clearly another thread to push these values on America. To try to show it is okay and acceptable because we made a movie about it. I wish I could give it zero stars. This is truly gutter trash!	1.0	0

med_194285	A good ending to this series. A lot of the fighting is the same as the past seasons as well as the overdone sex scences. Spartucus is on the run from a new Roman leader and Julisus Ceasar. Spartucus was still able to play a good cat and mouse game. Thought Ceasar should have done a lot more to show why he was able to lead Rome but this is still a Spartucus story. If you liked the other seasons you should enjoy this finale.	4.0	1

med_194301	The acting was great, ( I LOVE Kris Kristofferson) the story was broken down and told very well. The maddening thing is I guess we will never know who killed that beautiful, defenseless little girl. The brother was almost completely left out of the story. (?) Good DVD!

med_194313	My rating is for this particular DVD reproduction of the film, not the film itself.

The only complaint I have about this movie is that I wish it lasted longer. It's wonderful in every way."	5.0	1

med_194376	Hurt my eyes to watch. Movie was so blurry that after a few minutes, had to quit watching and turn it off. Very disappointing. My wife and I thoroughly enjoy watching Hindi and Tamil movies. Hopefully something will be done to improve the quality.

med_194394	I fell asleep while watching on Amazon but I can recall from my memories...it was a very exciting movie. The animated movies were rare for me and the children of my generation where I grew up. I can also remember the singing and the fast moving screens -- we were so young and were completely mesmerized! Perfect for young children and up to 5-6th grades, and even beyond. I'd suggeest that encourage children to read the story first. The film is well preserved. 4 starrs!	4.0	1

med_194402	we love the original totoro and did not realize that this new version had been so disney-fied. it borders on sacrelige for those of us that love totoro. the voices are too harsh and loud, the music and singing at the beginning is harsh and loud. we could only watch about ten minutes of it and are currently looking for a copy of the original movie. it was a very dissapointing experience.	1.0	0
med_194404	A real stinker. Satire is an art which this movie just can't seem to grasp. It just keeps missing the point. Not even Clooney can save this POS. It isn't funny, it isn't thought provoking, it isn't....well, it should never have been a movie. I don't understand why the folks who make films can't spot a bomb when they see one.

I do not recommend this yoga DVD if one wants to utilize yoga to stretch and tone.	1.0	0
med_194407	The Imitation Game is the story of the man who broke the German code and helped to shorten the war. It is quite wonderfully acted, by Benedict Cumber batch and the rest of the cast. The atmosphere of Oxford, wartime Britain and the muddled years after the war are splendidly done. But this is an intricate and ultimately sad film and is not at all for children or even, perhaps, a cosy night by the fire. It will surely rank as one of the truly greats.	5.0	1
med_194408	It is a great movie, but the DVD is so disapointing. Fox releases a single-layer flipper in 2003! All the two sides of the movie could be easily put in a dual-layer dvd. I really don't understand why the studio did like this. Make no sense in 2003!	2.0	0

med_194459	This movie was really bad. It appeared to be a collection of cut scenes that did not quite run well together.

med_194557	FYI, the entire movie revolves around whores and prostitutes. Obviously, if you're looking to watch a good western and not an R-rated film revolving around a brothel, don't watch this.	1.0	0
med_194559	"This follows the story of (You guessed it) a group of highschool students who are thrown into the chaotic world of zombie outbreak and death. If you love zombies and boobs this is for you, a great show utterly buried in fan service. It's almost as if the directors looked at dead or alive and said ""We can top that guys, right??""

med_194568	"This movie was awful. The acting was mediocre and there was essentially no plot. It didn't give any real insights into the lives of the rich or the conflict between rich and poor. It did not even work as a believable ""coming of age"" story. The director threw in some some gratuitous drug use and violence, but that was hardly enough to keep my interest. I was glad when the credits started rolling on this one."	1.0	0

med_194581	This isn't a review of the entire movie - just the first 45 minutes or so. That was my limit for this (almost) comically earnest tale of brotherly love and heroism.

The artwork is only so-so, and the animation sometimes drops to the level of kid-vid, but I like the characters and the sometimes goofy, sometimes very dramatic, escapades they find themselves The writers manage to balance this out without totally jumping the shark.

med_194729	It's a bit slow and you don't always know what direction the film is going in, but it's a great story and well done about a humble and gentle giant. A nice break from the over dramatized stories we so often see.	5.0	1
med_194731	This movie is a beautiful account of the Biblical story of Queen Esther. I especially enjoyed F. Murray Abrahams portrayal of Mordecai, Esther's uncle. The movie was authentically done.	1.0	0

med_194733	This is the second season of the simpsons, where the writing was solid but still a little Bart-centric, and the animation was still a little bit, um, developing. However, this is television history we're watching, the commentaries are interesting, and any simpsons fan should have this!	4.0	1
med_194734	Was okay, wouldn't watch it twice. Doesn't deserve a sequel.	2.0	0

med_194736	I've finished seeing the movie a few minutes ago and i'm still stunned! What an overwhelming exprience! The only bad thing about this movie is that i rented it from a automatic DVD machine so i't only gave me the first DVD and not the features DVD...	5.0	1
med_194737	Predictable, like the dialog and script was written by a 10 year old. Truly violent and yet boring throughout the entire movie.	1.0	0

med_194746	Self indulgent sleeper. Luckily, we were able to fast forward though most of the boring scenes. Pretty unoriginal, and very uninspiring.	1.0	0
med_194748	I never watched it while it was on Sci-Fi. It took a friend to tell me of this show and that it was out on DVD...so I bought it and well less than 48 hours later I watched all the shows. I have to say I didn't expect much but I got a lot in return especially a desire for a network to pick up this show so we can all see more than this single season.	5.0	1
med_194749	1 Ok so I hated the first one because it had a cliche predictable plot except for an end that was something I never would have expected. 2 Not a horrible sequel. Maybe you can consider this an improvement over the first but it is still rather boring and uncreative. 3 This is my favorite one of the series. It is actually pretty funny. The same killer, Angela, attacks people for no apparent reason with a log. It is so bad its good.	2.0	0
med_194754	This is a pretty good movie but not quite a five-star rating. I love almost any movie about Sherlock Holmes and you will enjoy this one.	4.0	1

med_194758	This product on the cover looks up-to-date and pretty modern but when watching it, it looks like it might as well have been in black and white, it was filmed so long ago. It greatly lacked entertainment value and I wish I had saved my money and just watched Animal Planet or Crocodile Hunter or something like that for free.	1.0	0
med_194759	I know that this show had been on T.V. since 2006, but I had never watched it until I just discovered it, and decided to watch an episode. So far I find that it has my interest through the first five episodes. Check it out.	4.0	1
med_194760	In spite of excellent start, the series appears to be stretching to link the past, historical mass murders to cover more recent events. Too bad really, the level of acting and production remains high even as the historical linkages become ever more tenuous.	2.0	0
med_194761	"Terrible! Just terrible! I'm all for a good action movie, but this ain't one of them. It's like they wrote the ""story"" line around the action scenes. The ""story"" was weak, forced and just lacked common sense at times. Really, really bad film!"	1.0	0
med_194762	This made my son start at Ucla. It helped him see the best quality of kicking and punting instruction. John Carney is the the best coach by far that my son has trained with. And I have absolutely no complaints about this film either. Just can't be beat.	5.0	1

med_194767	I loved Creepshow. I thought Creepshow II was fun. Creepshow III just sucks. It has nothing to do with the originals and even the vignette format is barely adhered to. Without George Romero and Stephen King, the Creepshow series can't work. DO NOT watch this.	1.0	0

med_194777	Like everyone else, I am very disappointed with the total lack of commentaries in the Season 6 DVD. I suggest complaining to Lionsgate vis Twitter. @LGHomeEnt The show is wonderful, and the commentaries greatly enhanced my enjoyment of it.

med_194799	"This is one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. The script--what the actors say--is the main reason for its scariness. They say things I'd never say, yet their words reverbiate in the mind. I love the ""acid trip"" aspects of the imagery. I think this is Zombie's best movie."	5.0	1

med_194818	The naked jumping jacks was disgusting. You could have read the news article about the KY incident in about 5 minutes and gotten the point about mind control. Most people have already heard about the Milgram experiments. You don't need to watch the nude / lewd acts on screen to get the point. This video is not worth watching.

Enjoy, you won't be let down!	5.0	1
med_194822	One of the reasons I like the first 3 Bourne movies was that they were, with a few exceptions, plausible to realistic. The main plot of this movie is built around science fiction (ad-hoc genetic re-engineering). That just ruined it for me and made it too fake to believe.	2.0	0

med_194829	"This is probably the worst of the worst of anti-Mormon literature. The writers are very dishonorable in thier ""research"".

med_194830	Awesome collection for fans of British films and at a terrific price! Blu-rays are packaged in a nifty, regal-looking box. Would've given the set 5 stars but one of the films (Vanity Fair) didn't have Closed-Captioning (CC), which is essential for the hearing-impaired. Having CC also helps even normal-hearing viewers understand British accents that can be difficult to decipher!	4.0	1
med_194831	The story line is good; a bit predictable. Good acting. Enjoyable movie.	4.0	1

med_194839	Benicio Del Toro really killed it with this movie. I love how they tell story from the side of somebody other than Pablo Escobal. The character does not look a lot like the real Pablo Escobal, but does a very good job showing how bad he was as person behind the rest of the world. Very sad emotional movie with a lot of action and conspiracy; just the right recipe to keep you watching. I loved it and I am pretty sure you will too.	5.0	1

med_194847	I was really looking forward to this flick. It has a lot of talent attached to it, and the movie looks great. Unfortunately, the plot is overwrought, the characters are not likeable, and the boxing is poorly choreographed. Watch Creed instead. It is far superior.	2.0	0

med_194856	I love Amanda Seyfried more and more all the time! This is a great movie with great acting, and it will seriously keep you freaked out and on the edge of your seat. If you like suspenseful movies without the gross gore, you will like this one.	4.0	1

med_194873	Really enjoyed this documentary on the old-style Jewish delis and biography of a modern deli man. While I missed the truly old delis, it brought back memories of delis I have frequented and by association memories of my father and other relatives. It also made me hungry. Well worth the time. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is that it may not resonated for those who have never experienced a real Jewish deli.	4.0	1

med_194910	This movie ages quite well. each scene still sizzles, and the cornnfield scene is as fraught with peril as ever. The lush backgroud throughout, and the cast make this one of his best! I love this movie, and I recommend it highly.	5.0	1
med_194912	As a fan of Bob Mitchum, it pains me to say it, This one is worth passing. Despite the support from veteran actor Wilford Brimley, this film about an aging con sprung from a life sentence is TIRED, SLOW AND GOING NOWHERE! My advice...don't waste your time.	2.0	0
med_194913	I started out watching the American version, but some of the characters seemed so unbelievable, I decided to try to French version. Unfortunately, it was not much better. I think my main problem is the unreal reaction of the people when their loved ones come back from the dead. Everyone seems to just accept it as normal. All of the characters seem flawed and the overall story just seems so unreal. I normally love these kind of dark shows, but couldn't really find much to like about this one.	2.0	0
med_194914	The opening scene is compelling, but pretty much the rest of the movie is a set up to denounce Christ and label God as a myth. Do not give your time our attention to this movie if you are a Christian.

med_194915	The cover for this movie makes you feel as if you are finally in a for great, happy, easy going gay film. Instead, it is one of the most disturbing gay films ever with nothing but depression and repressed gay feelings. I don't recommend this.	2.0	0

med_194923	I'm glad I only rented this. I admit this sort of movie is not my cuppa tea. I won't be buying it. Owls are messengers according to some Amerindian beliefs. Is this why they were represented? I didn't get anything out of this. Certainly no fright. It takes something extremely scary to do that. Movies generally do not have that factor. Not for me anyway.	2.0	0

med_194977	My 2-star comment is not about the movie but the quality of the dvd. I do realize this movie is from the thirties, but there has got to be a better way. If the sound cannot be remastered, at least subtitles would help as much of the dialogue cannot be deciphered. However, the movie is a must-see for die hard Davis fans. If you fall under this category you should probably still get the film but be warned that the sound and overall quality are inferior.	2.0	0

His plots and his characters are chilling and entertaining.

med_195072	I liked this DVD. The concept is lovely, the instructors down to earth and likable. The only reason it did not get all 5 stars from me is because I was expecting more of a workout. If you're on the athletic side, don't expect to break much of a sweat with this video. Otherwise I really liked it	4.0	1
med_195074	IVE ALWAYS LIKED THIS SERIES SINCE I WATCHED IT AS A CHILD,MICHEAL LANDON WAS SUCH A CHARASMATIC MAN,I JUST WISHED THERE WERE MORE EPISODES ON THIS DISK,IVE GOT TO BUY SEASON 1 NOW AND SEASON TWO,LOVE WATCHING IT THOUGH.	5.0	1

med_195076	"It was a really good reenactment of Wes Craven's ""The Hills Have Eyes"". I was glued to the screen, I remember feeling emotional when the Hillbillies did *that* to the family. It was a really good movie but I gave it four stars because it was a bit too gruesome!"	4.0	1
med_195077	Definitely one for Thanksgiving Dinner - a real turkey Putting on one side the appalling print and sound quality, and suffering from a dreadful transfer to DVD, the film itself should get an award for awfulness. Inept mis-en-scene, risible dubbed dialogue, incoherent story, and pathetic acting. Why Kinski & Chaplin got involved, goodness alone knows. How do people raise money for ventures like this? Plus points - it's cheap and in a decent jewel case!	1.0	0

med_195079	Very interesting look into production and storage of corn. Would like to have seen more information regarding all the multitude of things that corn is used for, and how heavily saturated everything in our environment is with corn and corn derivatives. This wasn't quite as 'information packed' as I hoped. More just a novice's look into the world of farming corn. As a person who has corn allergy, I have discovered much more on my own about corn than this video actually shows. Well presented, at least.	4.0	1
med_195080	I had been looking for a kundalini yoga instructional video because it was recommended to me by a yoga therapist to try that style.

The disc features and Anamorphic Widescreen transfer(2:35:1), digitally mastered audio, an English or Cantonese language track with optional English subtitles, and an Audio Commentary by Hong Kong film expert Rick Meyers. You couldn't ask for anything more, except for some cast interviews reflecting back on the significance of this film. Overall a solid package deserving to be on any martial arts fans shelf.	4.0	1

med_195104	This movie is just plain fun. Don't look for deep meaning, complex imagery, or complexity. There are just good-bad people against bad-good people. The main character robs banks and his enemies are tying to protect humanity from people with special powers. It gets no more real than a Marvel Comic, but it is still fun. This is not Bladerunner, 2001, or Soylent Green. It is a very enjoyable film from beginning to end. Don't think too hard and just let it wash over you.	4.0	1

med_195112	It's hard to believe that the life of a fascinating man like Crowley can be rendered so turgidly. Ken Burns would do the job more imaginatively and creatively, revealing the man's genuine accomplishments as well as his self-advertising ways, and the construction of a mixed legend during his life as later.

med_195115	This movie cannot look better. I do prefer the Final Cut, but since 4 versions of the film exist in this package, I think the 'voiceover' fans will be happy too. All versions were 'remastered' and look and sound incredible! This movie says so much without saying alot verbally. Perhaps my favorite disc is #2. A plus 2 hour documentary on the making of Bladerunner. Very in depth and revealing for any true fan of the film. This is what science fiction is meant to be.	5.0	1

med_195141	Under The Skin was the absolute worst science fiction art film I have ever seen. Even the performance of Ms. Johansson was drab and dull. There seemed to be no plot, characterization, or reason I can imagine to have turned this into a movie and make it redeeming or have purpose. From the opening scene until the very last footage was not only confusing, but poorly translated from the novel to film.	1.0	0

med_195151	Really bad movie! Whatever the two stars were doing, it wasn't acting. Nicolas Cage makes another stinker. Hope this helps fix his much written about financial problems. It is sad what poor plastic surgery can do to a cute star like Nicole Kidman. Even with all the makeup, her face is so bad it's hard to look at. Sorry I rented it, a complete waste of money.	1.0	0
med_195152	First off i thought the film was fantastic! Sure it summarizes the first few episodes of the anime, but everything looks so much more pretty.

All in all a great purchase!	5.0	1

med_195237	I was looking for some old 70 gems with some exploitation in them. theses do not come close one of these movies is in black and white. I didn't make it far enough to know if there was any character build up or plot. The movie couldn't hold my attention.	2.0	0
med_195238	This movie is based on the true story of Billy Mills who left his reservation to attend college, became a star runner, but had trouble fitting in.

med_195248	First let me say that this movie is hilarious and awesome. The problem is that the discription states that it comes with the digital copy but it definitely does not, it's the Blu-ray Disc only. That probably explains why it was a great price when I got it. So if you're not concerned about the digital copy then this is a great movie to own for multiple viewing like my wife and I have done.	2.0	0

med_195265	Wow...what a jumpy, choppy, uninteresting story. There are many great actors in this movie that just seem lost. Hunt does a great job with her character, but the movie isn't strong enough for it. Broderick was just an extra it seemed, appearing in random segments. Midler's performance was annoying. Poor Firth should have picked a better script as well. Don't bother with this one. This movie just proves the extreme excess that Hollywood pays for substandard quality.	2.0	0

med_195271	Bought this for $5 from Walmart. One of the worst movies I've seen. Got it for the kids I nanny and we made it about 15 minutes in before shutting it off.

med_195274	What a great collection! Being born in 1956 and watching this later on TV, this was my favorite. I wrote to Noel Neill about 1998 and she graced me with an autograph photo with herself and Superman, along with a personal note. Great additional disc on special effects, along with Jimmy and Lois as they look now. I remember these episodes being in color, and the quality is great, considering being 50 plus years old!	4.0	1

med_195282	Not the deepest movie of all time, but I'm a sucker for movies about Men of Honor perservering against the liers and cheaters of the world. (In my opinion Rob Roy is another, better version of this story.) The action sequences are top-notch and Russell Crowe portrays the quiet strength of a weary veteran quite well. The plot bogs down towards the end, and the final few scenes were a bit too melodramatic for my taste, but that's ok.	4.0	1

med_195285	The usual mix of excellent to so-so episodes with one real stinker: Disclosure. This season has one of my personal favorites: Sight Unseen. If you're an SG1 fan, however, you'll savor them all. Even Disclosure gives the late, great Don Davis a chance to work his General Hammond character. That alone is worth a watch.	4.0	1

Love this.	4.0	1
med_195291	I thought the Movie was slow. It may have been better without Brad Pitt, I thought he mailed in his performance...Lessor known actors May have pulled off the charactor..made it more interesting. Then again, It may have just been a combination of poor directing & lethargic acting.	2.0	0

med_195415	Couldn't give it zero stars because that was not an option. I deserve a refund. I work hard for my money and this was equivalent to throwing cash out of a window.

med_195416	Tina Fey was definitely the highlight of this movie production. The script premise was not believable. The character reactions to various external (predictable) events did not appear as realistic. Most of the story flow could best be described as contrived.

med_195424	I was looking forward to this film as it boasted a fine array of top actors. Unfortunately, this is an extremely plodding and at times soporific narrative about a pack of old boys rambling around the countryside in search of Nazi loot.

I will watch another episode to see if the writers can actually bring off the change in a believable fashion. They did a good job of showing her as a screwed up nut-case (many of us may have experienced such an experience to a greater or lesser degree if we are honest) - now, will the plot actually lead somewhere?	2.0	0

med_195479	This movie seemed unnecessarily dark and melodramatic, and despite a fairly charming preview, turned out to be really low on humor. Why, oh why, couldn't the people who made this movie trusted that the book was delightful and interesting enough on its own? Why add a wartime setting, a dead father, and bombs, as well as giving the water horse PTSD? Skip it.	1.0	0
med_195480	This one is another attempt to recreate the Jane Eyre novel, but it too falls short. I find the characters cold and don't make it believable at all. This is yet another version of Jane Eyre that I'm sad to say I will Never Buy - never. The screenwriter and director could have done better if they had just put more effort into it. I can, however, recommend the Timothy Dalton 1983 Version as well as the Toby Stevens 2006 Version. They are fabulous!	1.0	0

med_195499	Leslie Howard and David Niven do a reasonable job in this early WWII made movie about the professional life of RJ Mitchell, the designer of the Spitfire and many of Supermarine's trophy winning designs.

med_195510	I'm not sure how I missed this one coming out in the big screen, but I did, and sorry I did. I found this to be a great story, and a heartbreaking one at the same time.

med_195523	Do not watch this movie for the acting or the gripping storyline, both of those categories are pretty bad. However the CGI and special effects are pretty brilliant.

med_195565	all that money and style could not make up for the pathetic line delivery, especially of Juliet, but we can't blame the actress for someone's lame attempt at re-writing Shakespeare...mixing Shakespeare's original text with new copy as if The Bard had made mistakes.	2.0	0

med_195567	"My darling boyfriend is a chef, and in turn, so are most of his friends. I am a fan of British humor, and in turn so is my darling boyfriend.

Egotistical, sensitive, manic, impatient, brilliant, clueless, and downright adorable. Although much might be lost if you don't have a chef in your life."	5.0	1

med_195572	I was really happy with the fact that there are 3 claymation specials on the DVD. But they didn't really do anything to clean up the images or add any features.

med_195589	I did not enjoy this movie as much as the critics did. Christian Bale was a big, nervous overdone mess in this role and Bradley Cooper needs less demanding roles. You can't just get through this period piece with bad hairstyles and loud emoting. The story was not very interesting and there was no one character I really cared for. Robert De Niro made an appearance in this film but they treated him solely as an icon - like he was sent by Scorcese to bless the proceedings.	1.0	0
med_195590	Unfortunately, the screenwriter completely changed the story of Under the Tuscan Sun. True, the main character did buy a villa in Tuscany. However, this story primarily concerns Diane Lane's trauma of divorce and trying to find herself in Italy. The film has very little about the trials of her renovation of the villa. Most importantly, the film says nothing about the book's description of life in a small Tuscan village and the people who live there. I was very disappointed in the film.	2.0	0

med_195725	"Has poor sound quality. Sound sometimes fades to almost nothing. DVD does ""hic-cup"" in one place; but decided to keep it as not sure we could find a better sound quality since movie is old.

med_195731	I really didn't like this movie. I loved the Harry Potter movies, but this one was excruciating to watch. Eddie Redmayne was not meant for these movies. That hang dog look of his and slump shouldered manner is just irritating. Dan Fogler played the best part in the movie. The only thing that made the movie worth watching was the final scene with the bird.	2.0	0

med_195739	This film was FAR less charming than The Singing, Ringing Tree.

med_195763	Exercises were ok but very scattered. My problem was that it didn't seem like the 2 of them actually got together and planned this video. They were all over the place, one didn't know what the other was doing, and very poorly organized. It's as if they met each other on the street and said, hey let's do an exercise video, and literally grabbed a camera on the spot and started filming. They drove me crazy!!! I couldn't last through one entire workout!	2.0	0

I bet if you sold the episodes seperately the ones Jensen did would exceed the sales of the others. Oh well thier loss.

You won't regret it.	5.0	1

med_195781	"In my opinion, the synopsis I read for this movie did not do it justice. We ignored the movie for a long time and finally decided to watch it due to the actors appearing in the movie. It was not the movie we anticipated -- it was so much more. We ended up liking it quite a bit. This is an excellent diversion from ""shoot 'em up, bang bang"" movies."	4.0	1
med_195783	B movie at best. Actors are too skinny to pass for operators. Jumps everywhere. Poor camera skills and lighting.	1.0	0
med_195784	Kinda typical Disney take on a classic. Our preteen grandkids love it. All the characters are appropriately quirky, and the buckling of swashes with some doing of der is de rigueur. This is not your dad's Three Musketeers. Gee, should it have been The Three Mouseketeers?	4.0	1
med_195785	I thought they could do a better job. The material was good and the acting was excellent, but the storyline bounced around too much.

med_195803	Sooner or later, the Lord of the Rings and Hobbit quad-rilogies had to screw up, and this movie is a very big disappointment. Edited like someone shuffled cards and picked at will, written . .

med_195804	This comedy is a nice departure from fighting-packed bloodthirsty stories of run-catch money-grabbers. It is even some opposite. Mature friends remembered nothing from a buck's night in Las Vegas supposedly, even where maid was lost. They found themselves in different not-so-pleasant situations and even won 84 grands just to bail out a wrong guy. The happy end follows all their endeavours and newlyweds might be happy at this stage.	4.0	1
med_195805	Excellent cast, great story-telling, true to comics, great prequel actors. Loved Xavier-McAvoy and Magneto-Fassbnder. The DVD is great to have and check how they did the special effects.

med_195806	I thought this was an interesting story. Most girls dream! I feel like it is a tail of two people with similar morals, but different experiences. I recommend this to anyone looking for a cute movie to watch a time or two. It is full of emotion and different worldviews. Personally, I would rent it next time because I do not think this would be a movie to watch over and over like some of the more common ones. It was definitely cute though! Enjoy.	4.0	1

med_195816	This is a very enjoyable film for those who prefer films that don't preach social values or a particular political agenda. It features interesting characters, very good acting (some of it in minor roles), a story line with enough twists to occasionally defy expectations, and a very active sense of humor. It is also a film that supports my growing conviction that a really good film depends a lot on the supporting cast and characters.	5.0	1

med_195820	The Bottom Line: It's not like the first two Mummy films were great films, but the cast exuded low-key charm and the adventures were fun enough; in the Tomb of the Dragon Emperor, by contrast, the cast (conspicuously missing Rachael Weisz) goes through the emotions of the ridiculous screenplay while third-rate CGI dominates the back of the screen and everyone watching the film wonders why they even bothered.	2.0	0
med_195821	I was eager to watch this as I'd never heard of it and I love anything re WW2. I am puzzled as to why I didn't like it more, the story premise is great and it's a bit of history I was unaware of and some of the characters behaviors, especially making ethanol by evaporating it from aviation fuel was amazing! The actors weren't bad, I think the editing made the story disjointed and hard to follow which led to my low rating.	2.0	0

It is a video that sticks to the point without showing the unnecessary such as women parading around in next to nothing. A group of us watched it and were rather impressed. However most of us watching are not mechanically inclined. I also think that even though it was interesting and helpful that it was slightly over priced.	4.0	1
med_195824	I wanted to like this movie as I love romantic comedies.... but the slap-stick humor in this was too much for me to take. It's one thing for him to walk into a pole when he's watching her, but then in the same scene to fall down the stairs...oh, it was hard to watch.	1.0	0

med_195886	While I did enjoy the wise cracking werewolf, I strongly caution parents. This is not a movie I would recommend for anyone who would like to avoid gratuitous displays. I enjoy cheesy horror. It is just too bad that it is so often a marriage of violence and sex. I can only assume the writers have a deep hatred for women as they are usually killed right after they are stripped naked. That way the males can enjoy a salacious moment, become aroused, and then top it off with bloodlust.	2.0	0

med_195891	The only problem with these and all the others CDs of her, is that if you want them to load them in your computer so you can carry them with you, you can not. They can not be copy and today some computers don't have floppy DC's, so if you want to travel and have them with you is not possible. Maybe she or Amazon should have a site and give a code to buy them and have them delivered to a computer, just as the books. Best Regards	4.0	1
med_195892	Excellent Collection. These episodes are a great deal of fun to watch. The quality is excellent. DVD's are all together in the same box. Some people have complained about it, but I am glad to have the entire series at such a low price. Top Quality product.	5.0	1

med_195896	Beautiful Romeo & Juliet type romance. Very well made entertaining movie. Even my teenage niece and 10 year old nephew enjoyed this film. It had comedy, romance, music, adventure and sometimes it was sad. Shah Rukh and Kajol have a lot of chemistry together on screen. This one is definitely a keeper. After renting it I just had to have my own DVD and blu ray. Great film!	5.0	1
med_195897	This is a great movie! It provided insight into two different perspectives: a young person aspiring to have worldly success; and a parent seeking to provide his child with godly guidance. This movie highlights the facts that fulfillment only comes from Christ and that God is in control, even when it doesn't seem like it. Check it out!	5.0	1

med_195902	More of the same until towards the end of this series when a new soon to be regular character, Chris, played by Nancy Travis is introduced. I can't add anymore than what others say, other than, if you liked the first 3 series, you'll like this as well. The ensemble cast is what makes the show work, as with most successful TV series and again, they are strong and vital members of the show. Recommended.	4.0	1

med_195910	No history whatsoever, though it does have some dated facts.

med_195912	To say this film looks like it had been written by adolescent boys is a disservice to adolescent boys. Retired criminals are supposed to reunite for one more job. But deep into the show the only thing they've done together is visit a brothel multiple times and take a stolen car for a joyride. The only appealing aspect is the concept. Everything else, from script to cinematography to acting, is abysmal.	1.0	0

med_195935	The movie itself is an oddly compelling (though not great) slasher. This Blu-ray release is a best-effort to give us the ultimate version of a weird cult obscurity, going to great lengths to obtain the best possible versions of the movie (the original elements are lost) and patchwork them back together into the director's intended cut. My full Blu-ray review is available at Cinapse.	4.0	1

I fast forwarded through the AWFUL Season 5, 6 and 7, and only recognized a few of the characters.

med_196014	Once you understand the movie is about sexual development and the intense pressure of gender conformity, you realize the concept is brilliant.

med_196030	For some reason, Seth McFarlane thinks that exporting a snarky attitude with a modern voice and delivery into the Old West of the 1800s, is a viable comedic idea that makes it impossible not to laugh at the obvious awkwardness of it all.

med_196034	Don't go into this expecting typical stand up. Gilbert Gottfried masterfully delivers classicly structured jokes. This is a true old school comedian performing basic dirty jokes like a pro.

med_196059	I like this series even though I am not big into action films where dozens of people are mowed down every few minutes. I like the characters although they do seem to kill-off secondary characters just as they are growing on you. The 2 lead characters are likeable and interesting. One of them can't seem to keep his clothes on for a full episode, but he is good looking and funny so who cares!	4.0	1

med_196148	This movie makes a powerful drama of the border, and I think that it's the acting that achieves the power. Sigal Erez plays the protagonist Miranda brilliantly. Martin Spottl's direction is so smart that you won't even notice it until you look again, later. The blazing but empty desert and the danger in the night are equally and memorably filmed here, in a fast-moving (and emotionally moving) film you should see many times. I know I will.	4.0	1

I've been reading the reviews of certain items and wanted to let everyone know that you can buy the seasons on DVD at [...] I can tell you it's not cheap, but you get all 10 seasons.

med_196251	I love a comedy as much as the next guy but I was not able to make it through the first hour before turning this one off.

med_196262	I will start off by saying I loved the show and watched every episode of every season. The early seasons followed a story line but each episode was pretty much independent of each other. The last two seasons were fun to watch, but seem to be hampered by the need to tie up loose ends in all the characters lives all at once. I believe entourage to be one of HBO's best series. I am excited to watch the movie.	4.0	1

med_196281	Why in the world would you waste time adding something like this that would mar face of the Oz universe? Shallow, underdeveloped characters, predictable, uninteresting plot, stupid & annoying monkey companion (ala Jar Jar Binks style).

I also learned some things I didn't know about the show and the actors.

med_196294	I bought this for my AP English class. We were reading the book and I thought the movie would help them understand a little better what was going on. I watched the first half an hour or so of it and decided not to use it. It had no similarity to the novel and there were characters who were not in the novel. I think it would have just confused by students. The 1940's version is much better.	2.0	0
med_196295	It is utterly unbelievable that such a steaming pile of a movie could even exist. Like others said, the animation looks like it came from the dawn of CGI, and there are dozens of instances when there is just 10 seconds of silence! A better review would have been to just type the word turd 20 times.	1.0	0
med_196296	I often wonder why they make movies we have all seen a million times before. One assumes when a new horror movie comes out that they will at least attempt to put their own mark on it. This movie falls short at every level. Not a bad movie, but you have seen it a dozen times before. It added nothing new to the mix. A waste of time and money. Spare yourself the hour and a half of waiting for something new to happen...	2.0	0

med_196309	This film should have edited down and it would have made the action more convincing and kept the storyline tight. The mother was well acted and so were the rest of the dysfunctional folks, but the dummies in the RV especially the blonde dufus role was irritatingly spastic and stupid. Rewrite on her part might have improved it. It just missed the mark of being ok, but like so many of these things the blood and gore became redundant, making at least half the movie irrelevant!	2.0	0

med_196312	Today I had enough and threw the dvd away. I like the workout, but there are mistakes that make it impossible to lose myself in the workout and stay on track.

med_196434	Go buy the regular extended edition right now. The scultpture of Minas Tirith has two parts, with the top part being a cover for a velvet lined storage compartment in the lower part. Sounds nice? Think again. The base is too big, extending beyond the 'lid' and exposing an unnaturally flat crescent area that can not be overlooked. Plus it's so tightly packaged that it was easily to snap off an little piece of the sculpture as I attempted to extract it.	2.0	0

med_196436	Love it, I do so love it when Steven Moffat creates a new show. Jekyll is a new twist on a classic story, but not to far fetched that you won't think that it may be possible.

med_196437	Worth the watch. Not what you're expecting. I was thinking this would be political because of all the news and hype. I was also scared it would be a patriotic jamboree. The movie is actually a good film though, story aside. Obviously with this being based on a true-story, the film does hit home. However, for the actual film part it's well shot and does the actual story justice. You'll like it.	4.0	1

med_196446	I just viewed the CD after finishing the book by Amanda Foreman. Of course, a lot had to be cut for the movie, but the flavor of the period and Georgiana's beauty and fashion-sense were adequately portrayed.

med_196452	I was very disappointed from this season. It is in my opinion far less interesting than the previous Justice league seasons, or the Avengers. Every story is short, and a silly story about one or two of the characters. There is hardly ever an episode of true team work, and there are no complex longer stories with more than one part to them, like in previous seasons.	2.0	0

med_196473	The F word doesn't bother me much when it's used as an expression in extremely emotional situations, but in this show as in many other HBO shows it is used as punctuation, it loses it's effectiveness and shows the writers inability to communicate his ideas except in a cheap fashion.	1.0	0

med_196491	I love Cary Grant. He is a phenomenon. But this movie missed the mark on so many levels. First of all, Cary looked stiff and he seemed to be NOT enjoying himself at all throughout the entire movie. Cole Porter was a bi-sexual. I know that was taboo when this pic was made, but not even one little hint? All I will say is that the music was great. But that is all that is great about this movie.	2.0	0

med_196507	I had high hopes for this movie, being a Colin Farrel fan, but I was not impressed. The writers chose to use the S-word over and over rather than using more thoughtful language. The idea of not knowing what is real or fantasy is interesting, but was not developed well. I kept waiting for a plot twist that never came. Also it was just one chase scene after another without much of anything else. The futuristic scenery was interesting, nevertheless this movie was a total waste of time.	2.0	0

med_196576	This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. A star means there was some value In seeing it. There was no value, in fact it's lost time I will never get back. Terrible movie for a dog lover. The only likable character is the dog and even it Doesn't do much but sit around. Any dog lover doesn't want to see horrible people own a dog. The whole thing made me cringe. Worst movie ever. Don't waste your time.	1.0	0

med_196587	The aesthetics and visual effects of this movie were awesome to behold - and we would expect nothing less of Ridley Scott. Truly stunning to watch. As a prequel, this movie lacks the character development and general plot quality that would put it in the company of the other films in the 'Alien' series. Not all that I expected it to be, but entertaining and fun.	4.0	1
med_196588	For everyone who's seen or want to see this for the first time. There are 4 DVDs and each on last 3 hours. Unfortunately they cut off many important parts of the Novela.

med_196601	It's a banged-up, bareboned anticlimax of a novel, underfunded, only slightly competently filmed, at its best mediocre. But they filmed the thing, and dragged its carcass past the finish line. I concede that all 3 parts are disappointing for varying reasons, but.... Yes, somebody else could have done better. Well, why didn't they?	1.0	0

med_196614	I viewed this DVD -- I guess when I ordered it I thought it would be a better made product. The age of the DVD did not have the impact I thought it would.

med_196620	This was a quaint follow up to the first Marigold Hotel movie. It did have charming appeal overall. It introduced us to some new characters and the struggle to expand the hotel. It over all was a nice movie. Great cast of All-Stars. While it wasn't the first movie it was a nice follow up. I do recommend this movie.	4.0	1
med_196621	This program taught me things I should have learned in school. It would be advisable for some history teachers to show such an informative film to students. It is a wonderful film that maybe will hold some of the atention that may help them to want to learn more history.	4.0	1
med_196622	"I made the mistake of not paying attention to the date of the performance shown on this blu-ray disc. I assumed it was a film coinciding with the 1972 live album of the same name. Had I noticed that it was a 2008 performance, I wouldn't have considered buying it. This performance was well after Neil passed his vocal prime. It's the ""shouting Neil"" rather than the ""singing Neil"". To compound the problem, the audio is poorly recorded and mixed. Absolutely not worth buying."	1.0	0

It features great direction, almost 3 dimensional characters, an orignal futuristic plot, and great music. In sum, it's pure Carpenter. Good DVD extras. Highly recommended."	4.0	1

med_196652	With much lower production values and a storyline that is recycled at best, and boring at its worst, I would definately stay clear of this one. Part one is gorgeous, with bright colors and fun action with a plot that entertains and intrigues. This one is like watching a saturday morning cartoon from the 80s, filled with floppy jokes and bad acting. 90 minutes of my life I'll never get to have back...	2.0	0

med_196655	Digitally i could get a copy on itunes and VUDU. This studio is doing the right thing that allows me to watch the movie and not have to juggle 600 apps on where i need to watch the movie.

If I am shelling out 15-25 a movie when everyone else is stealing them digitally I should be rewarded for it.	5.0	1
med_196657	We all enjoyed the series. Thought it was well done and good history along with some personal prespective. Im sure it does not do the Vets enough justice but I think the everyday person can get some feel for how hard the struggle was for our boys. Having it on Prime was a real bonus.	5.0	1
med_196658	"The movie itself is good but the High Definition version I watched was worse than standard definition. Much of the time you couldn't even recognize their faces. I had just recently viewed the HD version on Amazon Instant Video of the movie for which this is a sequel, ""Before Sunrise"", and that was in actual HD as it should have been. I watched the whole thing instead of stopping because there's no method to get a credit or refund for a bad product."	1.0	0

med_196702	I bought this DVD because I remembered seeing Steven Wright on TV years ago and laughing until my sides hurt. Well, I have to say it happened again.

If you want a great time treat yourself yo this DVD.	5.0	1
med_196703	This had to be something done to support movie business in Louisiana - several of the cast are faces that could draw business on there own. But sadly each of these characters was poorly written & the lead love story poorly shown. As for the underiding story lines where everyone is morally corrupt on some level, they failed by leaving to many stories open. I am left to wonder did they think they could draw this out into a TV show or movie series.	2.0	0

med_196749	I bought this to go along with my ROOTS Collection but it is NOT worthy of sharing the shelf. I got bored by all the sexual content; which was pretty much the entire storyline. :0( I don't recommend this movie. The ending was just too brief and pretty much sucked... felt like it was just thrown together.	1.0	0
med_196750	Germanic tribes learned from the romans but they don't have anything to do with the Latins at all. They culture today is totally far way for the Latin cultures based in Rome (still exist in the Latin languages countries). Germanic people are cold people Vs. Latin (very warm). The looks are totally different. The Romans were dark and dark haired. The Germanic people are blond and very white (exception of very few who mixed with others). Get real!!!!	1.0	0
med_196752	The first DVD (1969-89) is the best one. My 5 year old is enjoying it with me and normally she says she doesn't like Sesame St. I think that's because the new episodes are all Elmo now, which my 2 year old loves. I've had to explain a typewriter and a phone with a cord :) Some of the 1989-2009 stuff we already have on other DVDs. Overall I think it's a good buy.	4.0	1

med_196766	seperate the dvd's by couple. If they labeled a dvd set by steve and kayla, roman and marlena, or kimberly and shane, ect, they could make ALOT of money. They have the past episodes at their disposal and can edit. I know I would buy my favorite couple (kimberly and shane). Honestly I am not sure of amount to large! They could sererate each couple into years (maybe by 2 years).	5.0	1
med_196767	This is a pretty good movie. I love Jonah hill he is one of my favorite actors this didn't hold up 100% to one of his movies but still was pretty funny.

med_196782	It could have worked but this is not worth watching. I usually like to give this type of low budget movie a chance but it was really bad; once the subtitles that you cannot disable, that take up 1/4 of the screen, started I was out (the beginning).	1.0	0
med_196783	Fine performance.......really creepy plot. You finally get to find out what or who is doing the killing. I was surprised, it was totally unexpected as to who and why.	4.0	1
med_196784	"One of the reasons for me purchasing the film was Gordon Liu's name on the cover. It turns out he is in very little of the movie. The English subtitles are poorly translated and at times very difficult to read. The story line is even worse, hard to follow and has a ridiculous ""batman"" vampire character. Do yourself a favor and buy a better Kung Fu movie."	2.0	0
med_196785	The church shooting in the film was offensive and disgusting. The stereotypes of backward, back woods, bigoted believers designed to make the audience feel good about the slaughter, was beyond over-the-top prejudice. Wouldn't be surprised if the recent Texas church mass murderer had his own, well-worn copy of this terrible movie. Thanks Hollywood.	1.0	0
med_196786	Bought entire collection, movies and final chapter...reverting to nostalgia, sure...but series holds up in action and new worlds of aliens...plot lines interesting, as remembered, and actors open up myriads of speculation. In all, I'm glad I have these in hand.	5.0	1

med_196797	No no no....acting is not the problem, but the writer keeps going around and around when we all figure it out hours ago. I hoped to be surprised in the end... nope.

med_196798	"I love the character development in this show. The writing is so intelligent. It is evident that the walkers will ultimately overrun the humans but the series is a wonderful depiction of heroism and resilience of the human spirit...and the need for humans to unify and bond in communities for survival. Lots of lessons on how to achieve and not to achieve ""community."" And it also demonstrates how challenging leadership is -- especially in times of anarchy and in times of peace each of which require a different kind of leadership"	5.0	1

med_196810	I have not really given this DVD set a chance to show its qualities, whatever they may be, because I can't. The poor picture quality is a minor concern, but the absence of subtitles for the hard of hearing means that I just cannot follow the dialogue, even with the aid of headphones. So, unless I turn the volume up enough to enable my neighbours to review the show, I will never published an informed review.	1.0	0

Typically I can watch MST3K/Rifftrax any time, but this one was pure awful and Mike/Bill/Kevin had nothing funny to contribute, so it was a truly painful experience. For a far better time, watch the Rifftrax version of Breaker Breaker with Chuck Norris. That one has laughs a plenty.	1.0	0

I try to do the right thing and purchase content legally. I have tons of friends who just steal it. Either buy the DVD or go through Microsoft!!!!!	1.0	0
med_196911	"I watched it and it was worth it. It has been a while since I saw The Ring (Ringu) - and I think there is a Ju-on2. They are unique in the horror genre (from Japan) but start to get ""formula"" - relying on the same bag of tricks - so I don't think I'll watch Ju-on2, but I'm satisfied I watched The Ring and Ju-on 1."	4.0	1
med_196912	This is a great movie! The main character goes through so much just like Joseph did in the Old Testament in the HOLY BIBLE. He finally sees that God loves him and knows that GOD has a purpose in everything he went through. I really enjoyed this movie.	5.0	1

med_196925	The fact that in 1975 they knew of a drug that could assist help 80 percent of cancel patients with a cheap drug and denied its existence is just the worst thing to find out after watching this show.

Amazon responded quickly, provided me with a free return mailing label and they refunded my money right away (Thank you Amazon) ^_^ There are times, no matter where you purchase items, that you will get a faulty item. I'm still satisfied to make purchases through Amazon, very reliable! Thank you for good customer service too.	1.0	0
med_196932	That's the great thing about time travel movies that are well thought out, many plot twists become possible, and Rian Johnson has written and directed a great movie here using this device very well. Finally a sci-fi movie that is worth the price of admission after so many big budget diasappointments of late. Goes to show you, sci-fi that requires some thinking will always beat out sci-fi that only requires CGI.	4.0	1
med_196934	Better movie than people give it credit for! The action is incredible and you've never seen superheroes battle it out like in this movie! Very hyped for Batman v Superman and it's all because of the groundwork laid in this movie!	5.0	1

med_196941	Winter's Tale w/Colin Farrell, Jennifer Findlay, Russell Crowe, William Hurt, others. - This is a story of imagination and plays with time travel. The real attraction is the love between the two main characters and how it transcends the time. Like any story, they have obstacles to overcome and there are joys and sorrows. It's a good movie if you are not literal and will allow yourself to be entertained by a bit of romantic fancy.	4.0	1
med_196943	Although it took me awhile to actually sit down and watch this movie, once I did I didn't regret it. The music is fun, the animation great, and the story entertaining for children and adults alike. The cast couldn't have been better for the characters they played, and you could see a little bit of each actor in the character they voiced. A great movie for spending an afternoon or evening with your kid(s).	4.0	1

med_196948	Great movie, wonderful, inspiring story. Much of the movie was shot on the beach/in the water, so lots of shots of girls in bikinis. The shark scene was not too gory but it was a little intense - if you have small children it might disturb them and you may want to skip over it. Overall I would recommend this as a great family film - we all really enjoyed it.	4.0	1
med_196949	Although older, this movie is not just action but a strong drama and includes great special effects for when it was made, great plot and nice character development. I will watch this again.	4.0	1
med_196950	They spent so much time in a boring back story that could have been used for acting. No the acting wasn't great but that wasn't the problem. The backstory was drawn out and boring. Made it impossible to watch.	1.0	0

med_196955	This has to rank up there with all my worst movies watched!! The only reason I gave it one star is because I like Jake Gyllenhaal. I can't believe he did such a movie like this! It was horrible! The ending sucked! Don't waste your time watching this movie!	1.0	0
med_196957	It is very hard to understand what the actors are saying. There is a lot of mumbling. The newspaper scenes are excellent.. I think the acting is good and the story is interesting, it sure gives a bad impression of Baltimore and the blacks who live there. I probably will not view the remaining episodes.	1.0	0

med_196961	I only sat thru till the ending, since i paid for it. Boring and mundane acting. Script and plot were weak. With the exception of a few outerspace scenes, the acting scenes were performed in a closet. Gave it two stars for the music score.	2.0	0

med_196966	This movie made me laugh all the way through!! A must see movie in my book, because it has all the comedy for everyone young or old and a love story which every one can related to. The pace of the movie is very energetic; it's not boring at all! Many different characters you can like and related to for my generation. Also you see many of the characters trying to fit in to a new environment. Never a dull moment in this movie!	5.0	1
med_196967	Huge Gary Oldman fan (and a fan of practically everyone else in this movie), however, I can't lie....this movie is BORING!!! I like slow moving spy thrillers. I loved The Good Shepard. This movie, however, is very very very slow, confusing, and lifeless. Can't recommend it...	2.0	0

med_196976	Really good overall. From the animation, to the sounds/music. Only thing I would add is maybe if they fleshed out the characters a little more. Had more interactions with each other. And possibly more of a fairytale ending. But I really liked this one and would recommend it.	4.0	1

Brodewicks car hinting at teachers salary, how boring his life is wchis wife, the sheer stupidity of student council electipns, young dumb one sided love all around.. Or rather Obsession. It was entertaining! Not an academy award winner but, just everyday funny.	4.0	1
med_196996	Most of the reviews were pretty good on this. My daughter is 3.5 years old and I felt this was way too young for her. I feel she is pretty intelligent, but all the reviews said they had kids about this age and the cartoon/story line is ridiculous. My daughter watched it for about 5 minutes and was bored out of her mind. If you're looking for a fun Halloween movie for your kids, this is not the one. No matter what age in my opinion.	2.0	0

med_196998	Requires finer palate of appreciation for subtlety & nuance! Acting- good. There was too much suffering. And it was that what was expounded upon in the direction and plot of the story! Too long and drawn out purposely to make it a time framed Bollywood movie that at the end of it, you feel drained instead of requited with the characters that they finally consummated their love and lived happily ever after!	2.0	0

med_197002	My thanks for the prompt delivery of this product. This movie was originally bought as VHS tape for my son many years ago and he recently passed it on to his son. Unfortunately soon after this tape eventually failed so I started looking for a another copy. It arrived intime for his birthday. They both were so surprised I sourced a DVD copy. They both sit back together and enjoy this old movie. Robert.	5.0	1
med_197003	A pitch perfect tale of overcoming loss and beginning afresh told with masterly skill by Jim Sheridan. Edges close but never tips into sentimentality and is marvellously upbeat despite some truly difficult circumstances the family encounters. With considerable generosity of spirit this is a film to lose yourself in and relish. Amazingly realistic and honest. Brilliant.	4.0	1

med_197024	As with most movies nowadays this started off promising, but then went down the cherry hill fast.... I liked the actors in it, but the story was very slow and a bit confusing.

med_197025	I haven't seen this 35 year old movie in 20+ years, and it was actually better than I remember it. This edition from Sony Choice Collection is 94:59 long and in 1:85:1 aspect ratio.	5.0	1
med_197026	I like Chad Allen a lot and rented it because it seemed...inaccurately, as it turned out, from the misleading cover...that he'd have a big role in this...thing. Depressing. Trite. Creepy. The French lead had all the charm of a mannekin. And LA's underbelly even less. Really, what are people thinking when they write and then produce this stuff?	1.0	0
med_197028	"The idea of the movie was good, I just didn't realize it was rated a real ""R"". My fault. To much skin and sex for my taste. Surely someone has enough intelligence to figure out a way to convey a movie without being so visually pornographic. It is okay for a viewer to use their brain and think instead of just observe. And, it would have been more interesting to know if Joe really got his life in a better place, he was certainly trying at the end."	2.0	0

med_197041	This is a good movie...period. Whoever wrote the review for Amazon was way off the mark. First off, don't read the box or the summary as it will only ruin the surprises and great turns.

med_197045	This is one any opera lover will delight in. If you love Verdi, then don't even hesitate buying it! The performance is shot on Sydney Harbor with a backdrop of lights and buildings - a bit unconventional and some of the building signs are a bit disconcerting, but all-in-all a TREMENDOUS performance. The singing is outstanding and the staging is well done. The chandelier is a true marvel, and reminds you of so many great opera houses. The Aussies did this one proud!	5.0	1

med_197047	Every situation the characters find themselves in results in a kind of deus ex magica, in which a switcheroo, or some slight of hand, results in an escape for the good guys. This device ends up spoiling any tension because the protagonists can never lose. You know that what you're seeing will soon be revealed to be a hoax, so you never believe it in the first place. As a result, the whole film falls flat.	2.0	0

med_197053	With a star studded cast of comedians, one one expect one laugh after another from this movie. Sadly there are few laughs and quite disappointing.

I should have paid the extra $5.00 and purchased this DVD at my local brew store.	1.0	0

med_197074	"I expected so much more from this film which is basically at heart a gay porn film with a little ""thriller"" thrown in - Any sane person who watched a man kill another man wouldn't go near the person, yet this person actually courts a relationship with him which makes you wonder if the guy is all there in the head. I also don't feel the film was fair to gays either, there's far more to life than sex."	2.0	0
med_197075	this movie is like an adrenalin shot, right to the heart. How far would you go for your children? didn't give it 5 stars, only because it left me with questions at the end, due to a quick wrap up, too quick for my taste, Worth the watch, will certainly watch it again.	4.0	1
med_197076	This is an intimate thriller in a vein similar to that of The Thing, where you have to wonder if the intruder is sick, if he is telling the truth about others being ill outside, and whether the two people he holds hostage are going to take ill, turn into zombies or something else. This will keep you wondering right up to the end, and even then there is another unpleasant twist. Nice work from the actors and a great location in Wales.	4.0	1
med_197078	Oceans was twice as good as earth, cause of course, the water. seeing underwater is always memsmerizing. Seeing the whales was touching, so as seeing the baby turtles, so cute even though those sorry birds were pecking them. and of course i love the dolphins. Excellent!	5.0	1

med_197087	I bought the DVD set based on some of the customer reviews here, but I can't imagine what show they were watching. This could have fantastic, if only the premise had been put in the hands of someone with real imagination and the courage to try to do something different than standard american TV fare. As it is, we sat for long stretches between the bits of actual entertainment that peeked through now and then. What a waste.	2.0	0

med_197098	This movie ended up being much better than I thought it would. The title even makes sense once you watch the movie, although the title itself is pretty bad, almost turned me away from the movie. I enjoyed seeing the Bat Family in action, although I was disappointed by the lack of Batgirl, who I've always liked better than Batwoman. Overall good movie and definitely worth watching.	4.0	1
med_197099	This series brought back a lot of good memories, and provided some clear insight as to how much it dealt with true biblical issues. Reconciling of estranged father and son, how to deal with revenge, vengeance, sorrow, guilt and a host of other human sufferings were all covered in this ground-breaking series, which featured veteran actor Walter Brennan. You can't go wrong with a good western...and this is great Saturday morning fare with a clear, moral message--something missing from the TV shows of today.	5.0	1

med_197159	I found this quite informative. I think this would be mostly of interest to those somewhat familiar with the subject. My only criticism is that the narration is very rapid and with a subject like this, it might be frustrating to those who have little knowledge of mathematics. To those who can follow, however, it is a definite plus and provides little known information on ancient mathematics, notably, Egypt, Mesopotamia and Greece.	4.0	1

med_197169	I do not think this movie was very well made. It is just like a laundry list of things with a few highlights and speeches. It did show Patton's personality.

med_197257	I was surprised to see the rating for this movie and found the acting to be poor and cartoonish. It may help to know what the target audience was, but it came across like a bad TV special to me. It would make perfect sense if this was low budget, and would not be surprised if people found themselves regretting this purchase because the movie was that BAD!	2.0	0

med_197259	I ordered this movie back in the summer so I could have a movie night with friends.

Needless to say, months later, I've come to find there was no DVD in the shrink wrapped case. Very disappointed.	1.0	0

med_197269	We have really enjoyed this series and it has been a very cheerful and relaxing show to watch. The setting and scenery in Scotland are beautiful and the show was off to a very strong start. Our criticism would be that some of our favorite main characters left the series mid way through or toward the end. We liked some of those actors better than the new ones. Overall, it was an enjoyable show to watch and I would recommend it.	4.0	1

med_197275	I loved it. After reading several 1/2 star reviews I now realize the damage done by reality shows. Many of the reviews said the plot was far fetched. Well that's what I'm looking for in a movie, DUH. But it's not a five star and it certainly not a one or two star either.	4.0	1
med_197276	I am a fan of this movie, but think there is some flaw in the DVD copy mechanism, not Blu-Ray. I have had to return two copies to Amazon and one to DVD empire all with the same problem.

med_197282	I watched this movie when it first came out and thought it was really boring and disappointing. I generally like Katie Holmes and think she was fine in the movie, but Christian Bale was lousy and so was the plot and direction of this movie. If you just want to see a series of technical movie stunts followed by a few mildly romantic scenes surrounding a plethora of neurotic, self-absorbed dialogue, psychosis, and horrible directing, then you might be interested in watching this movie.	1.0	0

med_197294	Bill Murray was fantastic, Melissa McCarthy was unconvincing. But it's a good movie to challenge the way we might initially see things.

med_197298	I wanted to like this I like the actors, and it was very well done, but the plot line is very heavy handed and feels very forced. The propaganda aspect really smacks you in the face. It was a real downer. Watch something else, you will be glad.	1.0	0
med_197300	"I found myself bored many times with the inadequate and repetitive script of this series, with the gushing Essex and unbelievable scenes in the royal court of the queen romancing her toy boy. This is an over long ""Shakespeare in Love"" with lots of gloss rather than a serious drama. The BBC's lavish ""Charles II"" series also tackling royal affairs of the heart is leagues ahead in terms of acting, drama, screen play and script."	2.0	0

med_197358	Descent effects and usage of minimal resources in this production; 5 stars for effort. But the story line is blurred with what seems to be a recursive plot which never becomes fully defined (or at least apparent) in this film.	2.0	0
med_197360	if anyone has ever been to sea then watching this movie just lets you experience what the Russians aboard the k-19 submarine went through in real life. Unbelievable courage in the face of overwhelming adversity.

med_197379	"A better title might have been, ""Chatty Neurotic Girls"". Very talky and static; not terrifically engaging, unless you like the idea of eavesdropping at a substantially atypical girls' night out. There's a fine, attractive cast (Cattrall seems to be rehearsing her character from ""Sex and the City,"" from what this cable-deprived fellow has read of that series), but (yawn) not much to do, and the situations are SO drearily melodramatic. More live nudity would have been an improvement."	2.0	0

med_197438	Poor dvd quality--there has to be a better edition out there (somehow I got a fullscreen copy, f**k!). Cast and script--will challenge your patience if you are not already into Herzog and/or Kinski. Personally found it disappointing, but more than watch-able. Herzog's obtusely insightful commentaries on his films alone are worth i t.	2.0	0
med_197439	ok...so...my daughter and I love Shrek. I purchased this from Amazon instant video because our Blu-ray was scratched beyond repair. I thought maybe I would try this service to see how it worked out for us. Unfortunately, I had a difficult time connecting, took at least 20 minutes each time. NO, it is not my connection, my connection is great. We love the movie itself, but this online service just didn't cut it for us :(	2.0	0

med_197450	This DVD replaces any basic overview that you would receive at a college information session. He explains the process of applying to college well, including the individual components, but doesn't offer any insight or strategy into how to approach the application. What are the tips and tricks?

med_197480	I started watching this with little enthusiasm and only because it came up in my video queue. By the middle of the second season I was so enthralled - so invested - that I could barely stand to watch harm come to the extended family. Throughout I found myself Googling for more information on the historic details, many of which were different from what I'd learned. I highly recommend it.	5.0	1

med_197495	This movie is everthing that I hate in one. It is a deplorable display of materialistic rantings about spoilt kids whos ego's are bigger than their brains. The script is unamusing, the plot awful and actors who look as though they have been picked from a Jerry Springer audience; the concept is completely unoriginal, and as for love story, well there's less cheese on a 2kg block of edam.

med_197498	Terrible for two reasons: 1. Really distasteful that the guy admits he's a crappy father and then tries to shoehorn his son into his career. 2.

med_197541	The movies don't even come close to touching the quality of the TV series. Spenser and Hawk seem like tired caricatures of themselves and Susan doesn't add anything to the mix.

med_197564	This movie is an apparent tribute to the 1970s/80s Italian cannibal genre (complete with a list of those movies and their directors during the credits), but other than having modern effects, it's a pale shadow of those films. If you have any interest in this kind of movie, go watch some of the better of the Italian ones. This one was mostly a yawner, with very little sense of tension, and very little investment in the characters.	2.0	0

med_197573	I own tons of Bigfoot dvds. This is among the worst.

med_197574	This movie involves tossing a cat off a cliff into the ocean--where it presumably swims to shore--putting a cat in a box and sending it down a river and over a waterfall, pitting a cat against a bear, which later falls from a branch quite a ways to the ground. It seems the many reviewers who liked this movie don't empathize with the animal actors who (against their wills) are forced to do things that clearly terrify them. This is cruel spectacle, not wholesome entertainment.	1.0	0

med_197604	a surprisingly good movie that does not get as much attention as maybe it should. it stars some members of the rat pack in a 20's gangster film spoof. there is some good music in it and it is pretty funny. bing crosby kind of steals the show toward the end, but it is a fine performance by the whole crew.	5.0	1

med_197610	I bought this DVD because I liked the DAYBREAK DVD by Atmospheres... but the 'Peaceful Earth' was far from my expectations....it was possitively discusting_ to the extent that I would not sell it on Amazon or eBay. That's my advice.	1.0	0
med_197611	actor Kenneth hughes says this is a terrific film. he's the star. I guess he had fun making the film, but never watched it. it's disjointed and annoying from the noisy opening credits. the film is not original so there are many other films like this that are better. I did not see or hear the closing credits so I have no opinion. I jumped off after 30 min. or so. but, you might like it. I thought I would.	2.0	0

med_197615	When I got this movie I thought it has to be bad but i was surprised. I had heard that it was made for less then 1000. but wow what a well done film for the price. The Cole Brothers are so resourceful in this film. There are some very scary shots. and the lead actor (Stephen Twardokus) is very interesting to watch. for the budget this movie is good. It's worth to rent or even buy for 8 dollars.	4.0	1
med_197616	Just well thought out presentation of the story. Fine acting, well developed characters (w/idiosyncrasies - odd personality types). I remember watching it when it first came out so I watch it again and was definitely entertained. Lucy Liu was presented as one of those odd characters and was very sexual in character.	4.0	1

med_197681	At first I thought this was an okay collection of cartoons. However, after I looked at the individual shorts, I am not so sure. None of the shorts have the title sequence. The menu does not have the titles of any of the shorts. I think this is a big deficiency as you never really know what you are watching unless you have some background in Felix the Cat cartoons. This is too bad as the films themselves look better than usually for an inexpensive collection. It could have been better.	2.0	0

med_197687	To clarify, the 2-star rating is for the atrocious quality of this blu-ray transfer; I'd give the movie 4 1/2 stars. It's super grainy and the colors are oddly dull and muted. I've seen many blu-ray movies and this could be the most disappointing transfer of all. I actually owned the widescreen DVD version (probably lent it to a friend and never got it back), and from what I recall picture quality was better. Skip this blu-ray; get the DVD instead.	2.0	0

med_197783	Diane Lane gives a great performance in this romantic/fantasy driven movie. I know many people dream of going to another place to escape the pressures of daily life and this movie does that for you. If you like romantic movies in a far away land then this movie is for you.	4.0	1
med_197784	Look, I read all the reviews that slammed the quality and I thought twice about buying this. Yeah, it is a 1977 movie made with 1977 technology. It is cleaned up a bit, but the soundtrack technology is stuck in the 70's. It is not BlueRay. So what! It is the version I saw and loved in 1977. I'm happy.	5.0	1
med_197786	Not amused. Hoping for a feel good movie and it just made me depressed. I paid way too much since there was no rent option.	1.0	0
med_197787	"Crowe captured every feeling I had for the music represented in this stunning movie. Anyone who can remember first hearing The Who's ""Tommy"" (especially if it was by a ""cool"" older brother or sister) will definately appreciate the reminder to how essential the music is to one's life. This is the best movie that has came out in a while, very possibly, Coppola's ""Virgin Suicides"". Rent and enjoy!"	5.0	1

med_197791	"The DVD was not what I expected. IMO, it was more of a ""highlight"" video of him catching bass. I thought it would show more kayak bass fishing techniques and other information related to kayak fishing. The DVD didn't even come in a nice DVD case. It seems like the DVD was just a ""boot-leged"" copy of some original. The production of the DVD was just average at best."	2.0	0
med_197792	Wow. This was a very entertaining & well-done documentary that depicts the struggle of a gamer trying to enter the realm of competitive Donkey Kong. There is a definite bias towards Steve Wiebe but that's because Billy Mitchell makes the perfect villain (let's be completely honest). It's hilarious and compels you to watch further, showcasing each player in all their obsessive glory.	5.0	1
med_197794	Decent but meandering story. Some loose ends are left over even after the last 5 minutes of the film. Compared to her sisters ALONE and SHUTTER, BODY 19 really only excels in terms of special effects and make up effects, but lacks the uniqueness of the former or the eeriness of the latter.	2.0	0
med_197796	Based on the idea that the banjo was developed in the US but really came from African instruments. Our host brings the instrument to Africa and attempts to blend in with the music there. The results are interesting as he meets lots of talented musicians. I watched this with my 1 year old daughter and she was riveted every time they played a song. 1 year olds are not noted for long attention spans....she enjoyed this musical documentary as much as I did.	5.0	1

med_197803	"This movie shows you what religious fanaticism and the non-separation of church and state can lead to. Once upon a time the nations of Europe were basically Christian theocracies and we had the Catholic church arresting people for heretical ""crimes"" such as being gay or practicing Judiasm in secret. Those arrested had no rights and would be tortured to confess. Movies like this are an important reminder as to why theocracies are so bad and why the separation of Church and State is so important."	5.0	1

There's tons of excitement, laughable history lessons, fantastic filming, loveable characters, tons of good child geared humor... but adults will love it, too.

med_197835	Finally, a movie that deals with homosexuality in Cuba. This issue, which has been absent from both public discourse and the Cuban cinema, is dealt with in surprisingly clear terms in this neo-classic.

med_197844	SIMPLY AWFUL! There are no title cards or openings except for the beginnings and end credits. I'm getting tired of these lazy releases. At least put the title cards with the episodes.

I guess, save your money or rent it off amazon and see for yourself.	1.0	0

med_197849	This version of The Nutcracker is OK, but not as good as the Balanchine version by the New York City Ballet. However, it is well worth owning for the breath-takingly elegant performance by Armenian dancer Davit Karapetyan as the Prince in the Grand Pas de Deux of the second act. During the curtain calls at the end, the SF audience applauds, hoots, and whistles as if they had just witnessed a sporting event!	4.0	1

med_197855	Essentially a comic book movie. There was not underlying substance to the film. Shallow characters, think plot line, inconsistent fantasy world. The movie had an interesting visual style combining animation stark sets with live action. I found the hyper violent content unnecessary. Again, the blunt story line was simply a thin framework for hanging poorly choreographed fight scenes. Since the martial arts sequences were cartoonish in character, and the story was not compelling, the action was more annoying than dramatic.	2.0	0

med_197859	Surprisingly good, as another review said already. I grabbed it off the shelf because I need to inject a little humor into my gore. It looked pretty cheesy, but it's actually rather compelling, and a little bit deep and thought provoking, with main and side characters that you end up caring about. I rented it, I'm going to buy it, and I'm going to recommend it to my friends. Nicely done.	4.0	1

med_197870	For obvious safety reasons, there is a lot of projection screen backdrops on a sound stage for the actors. There is a bit of actual being in the water on the boat or inside the canoe but thats mainly for close ups, again for obvious safety reasons for the actors given that this story takes place in the Everglades. Ustinov does a good job guiding and helping the heroes to their goal but those interested in finding out if he does make it to the end or not will have to wait and see.	4.0	1

med_197872	Wow, this is a bad video. The interviews are disjointed, jumpy and half the time the camera operator is focused on the side of the persons face when they are facing the other direction. The nature shots are filled with dirty spots on the lenses or a really obvious dirty helicopter window that they are shooting through. A very amateur production and not recommended at all. The only good part is this was less than $7 for the blu ray.	2.0	0

med_197881	Didn't realize it was so violent before I watched it. It reminds me of watching the old school Schwarzenegger movies - you know, the ones where you sit and try to count all the people that get killed.

med_197904	This 2 DVD set is a mess.

med_197926	I think that if I was in the 12-15 range I would have rated this film a five.

It also have some laughs and if you are a US Puerto Rican you will learn words and sayings that you have never been exposed to before- a little strange but at the same time sort of instructive.	4.0	1

med_197942	I really enjoyed the story as one that needs to be told. A black crew in WW II was something needing to be recognized. These men served their country well. They used so much stock footage that I felt like I was cutting to old John Wayne movies and back to a modern one. Still very worth your time to watch.	4.0	1
med_197943	Are You being Server? is one of the classics of british television. I have every episode on DVD and love them. I thought this would be the climax of my collection, but sadly not. It is a sad attempt to bring the TV show to the big screen. It's basically a very lackluster re-hashing of the TV show's various skits sewn together with a poor sub-plot. Even the cast looks like they didn't want to be there. Stick to the TV series, it's the best.	1.0	0

med_197947	This is not the First Season, it's only half of it. In my view this is an unbelievably bad decision because it dashed everybody's expectations and created resentment. I intended to buy the box as a birthday present for my roommate, who waited forever for this release, but we decided to teach the company a lesson: no full season release, no money. I rented the 12 episodes from Netflix, and I hope all of you do the same.	1.0	0

med_197953	I bought this item reading above 3 reviews. I am really disappointed by this dvd. it is definitely not for kids below 4 yrs of age. it does not even last for 1 hr and really not worth $15. i would pay $5 for this kind of dvd. As the title says that i teaches addition and sentences is just not true.	2.0	0
med_197954	Watched the show on TV.. or to say the first installment only. The acting was so terrible it was laughable. Its a shame to see 'big name' actors do such a terrible job. I am wondering if this was written by some high school students and adapted for TV due to the writers' strike.	1.0	0

med_197965	This is a generic, cheesy yoga video with plenty of 'namaste' B.S. to go around. The poses are fine and good, but the video doesn't really offer up any yoga that is different and specific to surfing. Maybe that's because yoga in general is just good for surfing, I don't know ... but I was expecting more. Save your money and just go to a real class.	2.0	0
med_197966	The first series is still great, nice blend of drama, adventure, comedy and romance. The transfer looks great and the shows quality and bondesque music still feel very current. The series starts with a band, starts to wonder a bit in the 2nd hald but cimes back for some of the best in the last two episodes.	4.0	1

med_198079	The movie: great. With a box-office of over Rp 1.8 billions worldwide, this is the highest grossing movie to date. The DVD: very plain. No bonus except theatrical trailer, and the print is letterbox.

So does great movies like Mission: Impossible and Top Gun. I hope the studio is listening.	4.0	1
med_198080	Great for a rainy or snowy night when reality outside the door is already shrouded in what could easily pass as surreal.

med_198107	Pretty closely follows a real incident in the French army. Although billed as an anti-war movie I don't see it that way. More a criticism of bureaucracies & the people who inhabit them. My father's division at Meuse-Argonne was led by equally inept commanders. The DVD contains a second copy of the film which is loaded with great commentary & background info. I consider it an excellent buy.	5.0	1
med_198108	I only rate it 2 stars PURELY based on the talent casted for it! Otherwise, an inconsistent, choppy, lame piece of work. Although predictable, the plot would be decent IF these actors had a good script to go on! Each does the best they can with what little they're given. If you're watching this movie JUST because it's a black cast, you may enjoy it! However, if you're expecting a great movie with a great black cast, you won't!	2.0	0
med_198109	The acting is outstanding. I also learned some new things about the Communist witch hunts how Dalton Trumbo and other writers survived. A few of the scenes are written poorly, (ironically) I think, but it does not get in the way of a good historical depiction of events.	4.0	1

None of the frantically energetic tone of exercise videos, none of the exotic terminology (which is often interesting, but perhaps not relaxing!?), none of the para-mystical approach. Just simple instructions in stretching, calming, and stress reduction. If that's what you want, I recommend this video highly.	4.0	1
med_198112	A great family oriented story; we watched as a family and the kids loved it. Conveys good morals and why to follow your own path/dreams/desire.	5.0	1

med_198115	Micheal Keaton and Henry Winkler are in their elements in this great film! You find yourself laughing at every turn, and you feel like you are back in time and enduring their professions. Bleak professions made funny to lighten the seriousness of them was great! This film does not disappoint!!! A great laugh!!	5.0	1
med_198116	Hidden Colors more than met my expectations. I've learned information from watching Hidden Colors that I previously was unaware of. If only the true history of Black people was taught in U.S. schools. I have already recommended this series of DVD's to family and friends.	4.0	1
med_198117	Beware...lots of these HD DVD going CHEAP because they are Warner Brothers movies that are known to have laser rot/imperfections. They won't last long if you buy them they WILL eventually go bad. Other HD DVD do not have the issues, these were a bad batch from WB.	1.0	0

med_198119	The iTunes part of this 'Digital Copy' did not work with 2 different sets of disks. While this is a first for me with Amazon products, it didn't work for me and if you are buying this to use with your iTunes account, you may want to know that you'll be spending some time with someone to get it to work - if it really works. Not worth the time for me.	2.0	0
med_198120	Great terrible movie. However, wait until it is $15 or less. Even though this is beautiful trash, don't pay the current $30+ price-tag. The Room is infinitely entertaining. One of the funniest movies ever made. America through the eyes of someone who has no idea how people actually interact and has been clearly hurt by some woman somewhere. Brilliant in its ineptitude.	5.0	1
med_198121	I was excited to see this, being that I like Jason Segal and Ed Helms. I can't say that the acting was bad, but the story was a snooze-fest. My wife and I just looked at each other and rolled our eyes. Very disappointing.	1.0	0

med_198138	I'm a Cage fan, and i feel compelled to say that even he doesn't save this mediocre production... Poor acting across the board, predictable plot, supernatural powers should be awesome, but instead they came out unconvincing and not believable in this one, almost as a farce... not worth $3.99, maybe $0.50	2.0	0

med_198144	The movie has a okay story line, the creepy and haunting music gets your heart pumping and the woman in the black dress is a poorly animated scary person, they could have done better. The story line is weak and goes by fast. The movie got two stars instead of three because of the ending. The ending is stupid and weak. What kind of ending was that? Could there be a part 2?

Also I doubt if there were 20 pages of dialougue for the the entire movie. And what is said seems to come of the mouth of california collage girl not a the Queen of France.

med_198162	This movie is good, just like the older version is. I love both versions. It's probably one of the few remakes where I actually like both versions. I love Martin in this version. He is so funny, although he should never wear a speado again.	5.0	1
med_198165	I don't have too much to say about the movie. The plot was very simplistic. There were a bunch of funny moments, but most of the slapstick made me cringe with embarrassment as to why I was watching this. The actors did an amazing job of capturing the spirit of the 3 Stooges; however, the forced jokes, bland dialogue, and Jersey Shore antics ruin the experience. They would have been better off making 3 mini movies with different plots instead of one.	2.0	0

med_198224	Watched the DVD in Blue-ray 3D and it definitely added to the special effects. I will say thr 3D is not as dramatic as some other 3D movies. The depth and sharpness is excellent but this 3D does not reach out and touch you like some scenes. The plot has been expanded and changed a lot from the,original Superman plot. I enjoyed the change and would recommend it. I have watched the 3D version only but have the 3 DVD set.	4.0	1
med_198225	I started watching this series because it was free on Amazon Prime. I ended up liking it so much that I bought the first two seasons on dvd. The first few episodes didn't make a good impression on me, but stick with it. I was hooked by the fifth or sixth episode. It's not going to be historically accurate. It's not dark and gritty.

med_198270	I've always liked this fish-out-of-water series, had never seen the pilot. At least some mystery cleared. Odd, tho, discs want to auto-play from the middle? Easy enuf fix, menu & pick episode. Pretty clean transfer, guess I'd prob'ly go with a 4.4.	4.0	1
med_198271	The show Lost builds up a lot of mythos in the first season and by half way through the first season, the rest is a wild mind blowing ride that you don't want to get off. The 40 minute episodes never seem to be long enough. You'll be watching 2 or 3 episodes in one sitting.	5.0	1

med_198275	Wonderfully executed film- although DeCaprio prbably didn't deserve the oscar. The direction and production skill is what makes this film. Almost every frame of this film is compelling art!	4.0	1
med_198276	I have watched this movie over and over again and I never get tired of watching it. This movie is probably what inspired the creation of some of the more recent disaster from space movies. This movie brings back childhood memories of the times when my father took me to the theater to watch movies such as this one which came out a year before I was born. some of the actors in this film later starred as character actors in familiar situation comedies like Petticoat Junction and I Dream of Genie.	5.0	1

Fortunately, I hadn't unwrapped the DVD yet and can utilize the return process, but be warned.	1.0	0
med_198280	This was a great movie. The adventure tied in with the first movie. Can't understand where I was that this is my first viewing of this movie as I am a Arnold fan.

med_198283	I must start by saying that I normally like romantic movies but this one was a rather stupid theme of an american woman has to go to Europe to find a mate as american men do not meet her standards. If you are a single woman into dating this movie will only depress you	2.0	0

med_198301	An excellent transfer from film to DVD. The studio really made an effort to make this 30 year old movie look good on DVD. The movie has a far greater impact now as compared to the VHS version. The sound quality is also excellent. Even though this is probably the greatest love scene ever on film, the clarity of the DVD leaves you glued to the screen through the whole movie. Now I'm just waiting for MGM to re-release Demon Seed on DVD which also stars Julie	5.0	1

med_198328	Visually appealing production of an engaging story. The acting is spotty. I enjoyed Tom Hollander's performance. The actress playing his niece looks the part, but I found her acting self-absorbed and annoying. All the other acting is quite hammy.

med_198340	I love Natalie Portman. It breaks my heart that her too-long-interrputed movie career gets going again with this one. She does a fine job, but the movie either tries to do way too much or tries to do way too little -- I'm not sure which -- leaving me highly unsatisfied.	2.0	0

med_198361	"I bought this just to be disappointed - this is not a concert DVD. As a concert DVD ""Unplugged"" in New York by MTV is much better. Best thing in this DVD is the Extras - where you actually get to watch Nirvana in action without much editing. But that's like 6 songs or so. If you want very short documentary and some Cobain interviews - then this will suffice, but if you want a pure concert without silly editing - wait until better concert DVDs will be released."	2.0	0

med_198377	First 2 seasons were good, but this season has much more drama/emotion and less of a business orientation. In the beginning of the season it is mentioned that Mr. Selfridge is buying several other businesses but none of it was actually part of the show.

Beyond that, the cast and director did a great job.	2.0	0

med_198429	For US and Canada viewers note that there are no subtitles which you will need since the show has many types of UK accents - some of which can be indecipherable w/o some assistance. Otherwise would have given it 5 stars. The lack of subtitles is strange since the BBC's DVD's have them.	4.0	1

med_198436	Verdi didn't like this opera much, and it is not on the level of his many masterworks, but...although formulaic the music does make its effect, and the cast, although not on the level of the Caballe, Norman, Carreras recording for Phillips, does very nicely	4.0	1
med_198437	This set is the first four seasons of Midsomer Murders. DCI Barnaby and his politically incorrect assistant, Sergeant Troy solve baffling murders in the fictional Midsomer County (Shire?); so baffling, in fact, that often several other people are murdered before the case is solved. The episodes are well acted and the local color makes these well worth watching.	4.0	1

med_198460	Wonderful storyline about average American women during WW2 stepping up while the men were away at war. No war battles, bombs blowing up, just a combination of everyday funny and sad moments of women struggling to get through life. Great cast includes Goldie Hawn, Kurt Russell, Christine Lathi, Ed Harris and Holly Hunter. Also a fabulous song to open and close the movie by Carly Simon.

The woman are ok looking the brown haired Paula looks better than the blonde one but all they do is dance around and kiss, it's STUPID save your money I love Franco's movie's and that crazy psychedelic eurotrash but avoid this.	1.0	0
med_198468	My 2 year old son is huge Thomas fan. This DVD has long introductions to each story in which children and adults are interviewed - my son couldn't care less. He just wants to see trains! We have a portable DVD player, and it is a big pain to try to fast forward past these introductions, and he (and I) just ends up frustrated. My advice - pick another DVD.	1.0	0

med_198475	Though I haven't seen this dubbed re-released version, the original Hong Kong version titled Tai Chi Master is one of my all time favorites. It is essential veiwing for any Jet Li fan. Not only are the fight sequences numerous, each one is absolutely epic. If super-hero syle fighting is you thing, you will enjoy this. The people who made The Matrix have seen this video, and so should you.	5.0	1
med_198476	Very disappointed. Thought it would be about Yoga. No how to at all. Naked girl doesn't speak at all. Just a few movements on her part, surrounded by empty junk. Other reviews were staged. It's probably not what you think it is. Can't imagine why anyone would rent it.	1.0	0

Scouts, or other groups will be bored by the lack of titles, visuals, and other items that would make it interesting. the only group this would be appropriate for is Navy Seals (which he is) that have some background and are used to sitting and being lectured. I bought it to show to Scouts and will not use it.	2.0	0
med_198482	I bought this in anticipation of my 2017 Grand Canyon rafting trip. I thought it was rather boring. I have since bought Wallace Stegner's book Beyond the Hundredth Meridian which I think does a more interesting job of telling the story.	2.0	0

med_198488	A magnificent cinematographical production, great acting, funny, but not very satisfying. Perhaps this is because after all of the effort that went into the film, my expectation was high. IMDB rates this 8.8, which is ultra high. I did not feel intellectually, emotionally, or spiritually satisfied from watching this movie. The film is about Hollywood's contempt for the general public, perhaps that is what turned me off.	1.0	0
med_198489	Funny, witty, amazing dialog that makes you enjoy every moment of watching.

med_198497	Surprisingly good movie and my favorite of all Robert Downey Jr's. I thought Heather Graham was great in this as well. It's one of those movies where I can't quite explain why I liked it so much. The cast just clicked together and seemed to genuinely have enjoyed making it.	4.0	1
med_198498	I ordered Jurassic World Limited Edition Packaging and I am glad I did. Because it came with blue-Ray, a regular DVD and a digital download.

med_198502	This is listed on many sites as having among the poorest image quality of all Blu-ray disks (bottom tier). It's a real shame, too, because this movie is filled with stunningly gorgeous shots filled with color and life. It looked to me as if the transfer was done from a poor-quality copy of the master. I am almost certain they will re-release this on Bluray one day with better picture quality, as has already been done with 5th Element and Superman. Don't buy this unless they do!	1.0	0

med_198508	This movie holds the singular honor of having been so boring that I literally farted myself awake while watching it, and that was the funniest part of the movie. Though I guess you had to be there. If you had, you might have given it two stars.	1.0	0

med_198514	"An enjoyable and fun filled comedy. This movie is humorous and lighthearted on the surface, but brings to light how prejudice can ruin happiness. This isn't a ""change the world"" kind of movie. But more of a, in between the laughs, you might think a little, type of movie."	4.0	1
med_198515	I thought it was a very good action, monster move, I don't understand all the hate, you surely can't be comparing it to the other Godzilla movies, while I understand, I kind of like them as well... but some of them are beyond silly.	4.0	1
med_198516	For when it was made, it's quite enjoyable. Acting is a bit off but the effects were good for then.	4.0	1
med_198517	I had too high of expectations on this one. I rarely buy a movie until I have watched it as a rental first and like it. For me this one was poorly done and painful to watch at times because of the dialog, sound, and lighting. I thought that the acting and story was great but the dialog and technical aspects mentioned just left me wishing I didn't spend $17 to own it.	2.0	0
med_198519	The show is awsome no doubt but the disc couldn't play every episode why?	1.0	0
med_198520	I only watched the first episode and gave up on it; The premise of the show is sooo dumb; a woman who solves crimes is so psychic that the dead send her massages in her dreams. There is no mystery and no suspense at all to the crimes; she miraculously knows everything down to the last detail, and we know that she knows everything already and soon will tell us, so why bother watching? A waste of time, there are plenty of other crime shows with some thrill to them.	1.0	0

med_198523	For some movie goers, some scenes will be very graphic. But overall, it gives the viewer a sense of the terror of that horrible event. Natural disasters are hard to comprehend for most of us, unless we were there. This movie takes you there in a safe manner. The devastation from this event will never be forgotten but also, the incredible stories of heroism and enduring strength of the people involved. A must see movie.	4.0	1
med_198524	It was part of the prime package when I started watching it and at about a quarter way through, it shut down because it was no longer prime. I thought that was odd for a movie to be on the prim watching list one second and the next second it is not. I did not get the chance to finish watching it hence the on star.	1.0	0
med_198525	I give it a 1. Reason is purely amazons fault. The movie froze as Ann was being found out from Henry. So I waited and continued the following night. But my 24hr rental was up so I never got to finish. When I complained to Amazon; after being passed around to 4 different people, this was my internets fault and not the movie. But all my other devices were working well. So .....,,.	1.0	0

There was also a lot of Gus and not enough Six. But that's just me. Overall, the makers seem to have missed an opportunity to really push the envelope on the series, rather then just cobble a movie together based on bits of other movies. Like I said, disappointing."	2.0	0

med_198544	"As a 'stand-alone"" film, this is entertaining and a wonderful display of acting with long dialogues that describe life as we know it. But I highly recommend seeing all 3 films, which then approach 5 stars as a group. In addition to terrific acting, each shows areas of Europe as a background. An amazing expression of life, aging and the change in priorities and meanings."	4.0	1

Every episode is really funny, but some people who don't care for British or tech/geek humor may not like it. The menu system of the DVD is also really cool. It looks like the old pc game Lemmings. It just adds to the whole geeky feeling of the show. I recommend checking this show out!	5.0	1

med_198587	This is a great Sean Connery Bond flick. You have the classic plot with sharks eating the bad guys and threatening the good guys. Both women (good girl and bad girl) are better actresses than most who were in these movies. There are some great chase scenes. If you like Bond films you will find this delivers.	4.0	1

med_198590	Take a walk in the lives of some troubled young men on the streets of Cali. It isn't the violence or street action that makes this movie great but the real life of the movie that makes it a great movie. For those who are not aware of the things that goes on in some neighborhoods or the mentality behind the things that are seen on the news this would be a great movie to watch and learn.	5.0	1
med_198591	This movie shows the 4 Kings Daniel served. It is very informative of the life and relationship that Daniel had serving 4 Kings. I will add this to my bible DVD collection it is one of a kind. Daniel like Joseph was gifted to interpret dreams and like Joseph was placed in close relation to the Kings he served.	1.0	0
med_198593	Terrible terrible experience with Amazon. I bought this on Black Friday. Got a great deal, but they sent me a bad copy of the dvd. For starters, when I got the dvd it was rolling around loose inside of its case. When I tried to watch the dvd it skips allllllllllllll the way through the movie. I have seen the movie before at the theatre when it came out, so the movie is hilarious as far as that goes, just had a bad experience with Amazon on this one.	1.0	0

med_198605	If I could rate this, I would rate it as a 3 1/2. The movie was slightly better than average at best. Casper Van Dien was so fake in the movie that it was hard not to laugh. The plotline was really not well written. The only reason I liked this movie enough was that the events was quick paced and the graphics was pretty good. The Omega Code 2 turned out to be much better.	4.0	1

med_198652	I started off my Vampire Hunter D collection with Bloodlust (the more recent sequel to this movie) and then eventually got around to renting this one.

med_198660	I bought this movie based on the actors in it, particularly Richard Dreyfus and John Lithgow and the reviews posted on Amazon. They are both really good actors.

med_198760	I am giving this a low rating because it has too much missing from it, too edited and cut scenes. I would rather watch this on Youtube or wait until I go to Mexico to buy the full series. It is difficult to follow the storyline and I do not recommend buying this unless you remember the series by heart and don't care too miss a lot. The episodes never end and you don't know when a new episode starts or ends.	2.0	0
med_198761	This was a Great Movie!!!!! Denzel's the man!!!! Don't see why the critics hated this movie. OH, because he's black and bad!	4.0	1

med_198764	Really unusual show. Seems to get into the psychology behind the protagonist and antagonists and explores greed, psychosis, belief systems. This is not an action movie and fairly cerebral, but definitely an interesting show.	4.0	1

med_198774	I grew up in the nearby area and my aunt is the waitress they interviewed in this documentary. I was young when she worked at the Lighthouse so I never was in it but I remember hearing them talking about the Lighthouse. I found it very interesting and great to see some old pictures of that area of Hermosa Beach as well as my Aunt Esther.

med_198776	I have suffered with fibromyalgia since 1995 and have always worked hard to stay mobile. The yoga on this DVD is for people with very little mobility and is also heavily reliant on props. Yoga that relies on straps, blocks, etc, creates clutter and I will always talk myself out of messing with it. The health info had lots of good basic info but nothing new. I really enjoyed the meditations but don't want to keep switching out DVD's to get the perfect practice.	2.0	0

med_198779	I love this season of Hawaii Five 0. The addition of Grover to the team and the inclusion of Gerry to the main story are both positive changes. The 100th episode is fabulous. Took me time to figure out what was going on in it which was great and the music and flashes of the past in this episode make it a very special one. Any fans of five 0 really should add this one to their collection.	5.0	1
med_198780	Not enough visual content to justify the animated effect. Or maybe I saw too much South Park first.	2.0	0
med_198781	The movie had great fighting scenes. But the overall story is lacking. The voice over for Freeza it's not the same person as the previous episodes. The personality is not there.

med_198799	I rented this movie on recommendation from the trailer. The trailer looked very good, however the movie was abysmal. It was truly painful to see such fine actors so out of place. The story was extremely contrived and maudlin. I just could not finish it out. I watched the last half on forward. Everyone looks wonderful and the costumes and sets are outstanding. The plot reminded me of a Danielle Steele type short story.	2.0	0

med_198817	The basic storyline would seem to be intended as a portrayal of events during the Nazi era. Another reviewer expressed a 'family interest in odd movies.' Perhaps I was expecting some reasonable rational in the plot to emerge . . . it didn't! There was no redeeming feature in the acting or the storyline. Analogy? Worse than the worst 'Twilight Zone' wannabe. It is unusual for me to not appreciate at least some aspect of a plot that I understand. Recommended? Viewer discretion is definitely advised!	1.0	0

med_198868	My Mistake - I thought I was buying a book and it was a DVD. I have seen many of the Dog Whisperer Shows so this was redundant to those. I keep it as a reference for guests in our DVD library for Eden Valley Guest Ranch (our small resort). It turned out to be a good thing as many dog people that come are not familiar with Cesar and it is a great introduction for exercise, disipline and then affection. :)	4.0	1

med_198874	I find it rather surprising that a online series has a international DVD release and has been redone so well.

When August 1st rolls around, I strongly recommend getting this!	5.0	1
med_198875	Surprisingly unfunny and dated. Some of the comedy felt like recycled jokes from the 80s. shockingly slow delivery for very little payoff. Not particularly clever and not bawdy enough to get by on offensiveness-as-a-selling-point. It just felt amatuer.	2.0	0

The camera angles on this DVD are changed every 2-5 seconds, and 75% of the time they are shooting Julianne's face. How can you learn the moves if you're looking at her face?

med_198889	When I first watched this remake of the guyver, one word came to mind: Lame. It's not near as action packed as the original dubbed version. The only good thing in my opinion was the lengthened fighting scenes and extra story line, but there was almost too much talking.

It could be disturbing for little children because the beautiful mermaid is not like the Disney version mermaid AT ALL.

It stops Halfway through, and only let's you start the movie over again; there is no second half of the movie. Even if you Try to skip to the scenes option from the menu. There are only three scenes sequences to skip through. What a ripoff!	1.0	0
med_198920	Very disappointed in this film. Given the quality of the cast, I thought it would be quite good. It didn't make a lot of sense, and didn't go anywhere. Felt the early demise of Sam Elliot's character resulted from Sam, himself walking out on a film before it was completed because he realized what a dog it was.	2.0	0

med_198932	This video shows some of the most fabulous festivals in Spain; exciting and different. Unfortunately, the narrator of this video delivers the most boring voice over in a complete monotone with no hints of excitement or interest.

Not being able to hear all of the dialog significantly detracts from the experience. This was supposed to replace an old VHS copy of the movie. The movie itself is an old favorite, the next project by the producers of M.A.S.H. Two (2) stars is for the disk itself, not the movie itself.	2.0	0

med_198937	There's no other film like this, and no other ending so beautiful. Stifling and unsettling (words fail, more than unsettling) at times with performances that leave you breathless, this is the real thing itself, conveyed with expressions rather than words, images rather than explanations. I never thought this could be conveyed in art but here it is. Love at a depth where nothing else exists.	5.0	1

BOOOO!	2.0	0
med_198946	Movie is awesome but the way it was mastered had issues. Surround sound drops out and from what I've researched, it happens with certain blu-ray players or receivers and no real work around without re-setting up your system (which I tried with no success) and even that is not guaranteed to work. Sony started out by sending out replacement discs but have since stopped only offering the weak work around that doesn't really work and should be a shame of themselves for not making this right.	1.0	0

Wittliff's literate, poetic script shows genuine feeling for -- and an insider's knowledge of -- the American West. With memorable performances from Willie Nelson and Gary Busey, ""Barbarosa"" is worth seeing. Unfortunately, the full-frame video transfer here is awful.

med_199092	I didn't care that much for the movie but found it watchable. The wife liked it a lot more than I did so that is the only reason I gave it 4 stars.......personally I would give it 2. Worth a rental and watchable enough.	4.0	1

med_199098	"As much as I love Idris Elba I got bored in 30 minutes. I have seen many, many movies like this and this story line is no different. I had to force myself to watch half of the movie. The actors and actresses were good, just the story line was ""old""."	2.0	0
med_199100	"Disappointed with this product from a well respected instructor like Dean Reinmuth and the Golf Channel. This is just a DVD copy of old golf channel programs. There are no structured instructions to ""Build A Better Swing"". There are health tips and course playing tips but not fundamentals on stance, grip, backswing, etc. There's not even a menu to facilitate navigating from one sequence to another."	2.0	0
med_199101	They missed a few key phrases but overal real good movie.	4.0	1
med_199102	I liked this DVD, it was a friendly introduction to the practice of acupressure. Michelle Cluck shows non-professionals how to perform acupressure to relieve stress and reduce migrane. As a long distance runner, I hold tension in my body that is not relieved with just a hot shower and leg stretches. This DVD taught me how to release tension in my shoulders and head and I had fun trying the acupressure points in my legs and feet. The DVD routine made me feel calm and at peace.	4.0	1
med_199103	I am not new to step aerobics so I did not think following along with the instructor would be a problem. However, I was very wrong. She does not do a good job at explaining upcoming steps or even showing them in slow motion prior to working them into the routine. I gave this video 2 stars because I did enjoy the 'pump' section of the video.	2.0	0

med_199123	THe previous reviewer did a great job reviewing this film. I would only add that Flynn is not as energetic as he could be because of his personal lifestyle. I think that shows in all his later films. Having said that, the ending was NOT what I expected and actually brought a tear to my eye. IMO, the ending makes the movie. Enjoy!	4.0	1

med_199126	This movie was a lot of fun! It held our interest and was funny. I like to gauge movies based on how long it will be before it's put on Netflix, which has a large inventory of every movie made in the crap factory. It will be a very long time before this is on Netflix	4.0	1
med_199128	"There's nothing better than Rent. I think the first time I heard this musical Soundrack was when I was a freshman in college, many years ago, on a road trip with some close girl friends.

med_199129	I bought this as a holiday gift for a family member who loves this movie. It comes with a DVD and packed with special features. But, I wish it wasn't so expensive or that Disney would finally release it on Blu-Ray and make it work the absorbent price I payed for the purchase.	4.0	1

med_199148	I finally got around to watching this movie and was blown away so I came back and changed my rating to five star. Without doubt this is one of the best movie to date. More than just a fairytale. Consider this movie a gift to grownups who grew up with Jack and the beanstalk. Now you have your own fairytale.	5.0	1

I do love animations but I must say that this one along with Ratatouille is by far the best featuire length animations I have ever seen! I also think this is Jim Carrey's best work! He really made Horton exactly as he should be! Great job Carrey!	5.0	1

med_199155	"This video is actually called ""Dinosaurs Dinosaurs Dinosaurs"" (the third of Eric Boardman and Gary Owens' documentaries about dinosaurs) and not ""Dinosaurs"" (which was their first documentary). That said, ""Dinosaurs Dinosaurs Dinosaurs"" is a very enjoyable piece of 1980's children's programming."	5.0	1

med_199160	The opera was well sung and well staged, however, it was in German, fine, that's what I expected, but given the minimalist staging and no English translation sub titles, the action and words being sung were very hard to follow. I do wish Amazon would always specify when there is or is not a sub-title translation. Was I pleased with my purchase . . . YES!	4.0	1

med_199182	This was Jessica Albas new role as an actress. She did great and the stories held my interest. I remember getting all my vhs tapes ready to record the episodes of Dark Angel 1st and 2nd seasons. I trashed all those bulky tapes now that I have both seasons on dvd.	5.0	1

Highly recommended for fans.	4.0	1

med_199196	"The Absent-minded Professor is an hilarious b&W comedy classic. However, ""Son of Flubber"" is a, you know, sequel. Sequels rarely live up to their originals.

med_199209	I have always loved the first three movies of this set and already own it in DVD format. I bought the Blu-ray version for $20 during the holiday sale. What a steal! Everything the previous set had, but now in beautiful HD. The Blu-ray box is one of the coolest I've ever seen. It is like a book and is very well done.

med_199213	This was such a waste of time and money. A bunch of directionless young fools, trying to act intellectual. There's no identity, just a thorough lack of creativity and originality. I grew up listening to hardcore and punk music, and those shows had so much raw intensity and energy. These kids plain and simple sucked! Walking on the American Flag to get into their freshly painted bus? Really? I'd go to a show of theirs simply to strangle them. Punks? No. Idiots? Definitely!	2.0	0

All three seasons so far have been well worth the money spent.	5.0	1

med_199237	If you are interested in Narcicissistic personalities, go for this. Some artists are genuine and credible, others the product of this personality disorder. The entire format of this series is cheesey and annoying. The spot with Steve Martin I found to be self-absorbed but that is what that no-talent is about. Waste of time and money!	1.0	0
med_199238	The film has some great atmosphere, spooky and isolated old house, and few truly gory scenes, but, that's all, as right through it alternates between tree brunches (pointless...!) x-ray vision of a ghost face which plays the most important role of updating the viewer with the story, and some slow-montion crap mistaken for action. Sorry. but it also gave me the impression it has finished before even started! If you are true lover of a horror movies, look elsewhere.	1.0	0

med_199255	This film enchanted me as a kid, and guess what? It still holds up. It's a landmark in Ray Harryhausen's career, but Bernard Herrmann's inventive and infectious score is what keeps the film resonating in your mind for days afterward.	4.0	1

med_199260	Everything is fine except they changed the music. That's part of what made it a great show. I don't what they were thinking. If you've never seen the show it won't matter but if you've seen the show I can't recommend it because the music is horrible.	2.0	0

med_199267	At the 50 minute mark I felt like I had been watching it for two hours. Very drawn out for such a simple storyline. Not entertaining. The story has a young man, on the verge of asking his girlfriend to marry him, travel back to his hometown and former girlfriend on a mission for his future millionaire father-in-law to basically destroy the town he grew up in. Seldom do I watch a Christmas movie and wish for it to end.	2.0	0

med_199278	This is by far one of the worst movie I have tried to watch. I could not even get 15 minutes into the movie. I have scene movies from the early 60s with better special effects.

med_199288	This movie was just way too long. The CGI was fantastic, and there were some engaging characters...however, the two separate story lines didn't quite work together and so the tension that was suppose to be there.. wasn't.

med_199290	Anyone looking to buy this film is likely already aware that it's great. It arrived quickly and in perfect condition. My only gripe is that it doesn't come with the slip cover that appears to be shown in the product image (which makes it inconsistent with other Miyazaki blu-rays we own like Howl's Moving Castle and Spirited Away).	4.0	1
med_199291	Product appeared as new but when opened, it had fingerprints all over the disk and scratches all over the bottom. It was a gift to a 7 year old. I have asked her parents to play it and review for defects before deciding what to do	2.0	0
med_199292	Like the books, this film is both engaging and redundant. Impressive task to whittle down the first book into a screen play, even if it is 3+ hours long. Ultimately, the fate of the four hobbits is the heart of the books and the most touching connection. Not sure that comes across here.	4.0	1
med_199293	Rusell Crow gives an OSCAR PERFORMANCE. Crowe is spectacular; he salvages the movie. Unfortunately for Crow that particular year the Oscars were not given based on good acting.

med_199309	I don't think there is a moment here the actors didn't phone in, not a plot twist the audience doesn't see coming from a mile away, and now in the benefit of time not a special effect that doesn't look dated and poor. It's always a bad sign when even the comic relief seems bored and tired. Not even bad enough to be good, this is the definition of a movie only good as background noise while you're busy with something of actual interest.	1.0	0

med_199315	"Amazing movie with wonderful bonus features. Although it is ""based"" on Meg Cabot's The Princess Diaries books, they are two completely different stories and stand on their own. For example, in this movie the grandmother Claire (portrayed by the wonderful Julie Andrews) is sweet and caring while in the books she is a nightmare. However, they did keep Mia's charm, awkwardness, clumsiness, and her good heart. Anne Hathaway played her role amazingly."	5.0	1

med_199332	The movie is basically about GI Joes and Ninjas. There are only a couple of interesting action scenes. For example, the sword fighting scenes on the mountain cliff covered with snow. Most of the time, the sword fighting is repetitive for people who have seen a lot of Chinese kung fu films. It's predictable from the beginning till the end. There's only one surprise regarding the bugs that can... The acting is not engaging. Because of all the reasons above, I gave it 2 stars.	2.0	0
med_199335	Enjoyable, funny and extremely entertaining. Tom Hanks does it again. Characters are well developed,and the music is great and well performed. Dialogue is short, sweet and to the point. I upgraded from the VHS tape to Blue Ray. Well worth the cost.	5.0	1
med_199336	Enjoyed this movie right up until the ending. Seemed to leave me (the viewer) with some unanswered questions. If there had planned on being a sequel, then that may have solved that. But with PSHs passing, I'm sure that will not happen.	4.0	1

med_199340	The child actor was annoying at best and generally irritating. Made it very difficult to possibly like the rest of the movie.

I can think of a lot of other ways I would have rather spent the rental fee.	2.0	0
med_199343	For movie fans of the original Mad Max films, this film fails to meet the interest standard of the originals. It has a thin plot, mostly based on an escape across the desert with lots of stunt action. Yet, the thin plot, lacking strong character development and motivation, is the escape from a tyrant by females lacking any real character development.	2.0	0

The tongue-in-cheek humor used in the sound track at the falling of the ceiling rocks is really over the top: the tune for the hymn ""O Sacred Head Now Wounded""! Given that this hymn was not published until 1601 makes it really out of place. This would make a great story without all the gore."	2.0	0

med_199455	"I've probably put this film on a hundred times. It's the kind of movie that I leave on in the background while I'm working. It doesn't have a very solid plot and the production quality is terrible, but there's a certain low-budget charm to it that I can't deny. If you enjoy low budget, ""backyard style"" films, you'll probably get a kick out of Killer Nerd. Check out Part II (Bride of Killer Nerd) for a better cinematic experience though."	4.0	1

med_199473	Weak story with limited character development makes the characters forgettable. Once they've left the screen there's no follow up.

I wish I could have my time back & I'm surprised the screenplay with approved for production.	1.0	0

med_199494	Has there ever been a more earnest host than Ryan? I doubt it. This show is very, very average. Nothing paranormal ever happens, and they certainly never capture any paranormal activity.

The Stuttgart production is in every way far superior (for instance, the prelude is riveting in Stuttgart and dull in this one and the class distinctions, which are an essential part of the story, are clear in Stuttgart but obscure here) but it's only available on VHS.

Having been in Africa and seen malaria first-hand, it is a sad reality that so many children (and adults) die from this disease. The movie is a dramatization of a real issue.

Without Wayne and Hepburn, this belated sequel to ""True Grit"" would not pass muster as a made-for-TV movie. It's too bad Peter Bogdanovich didn't take up the Duke's offer to direct the project - he might have improved upon the routine script. This was Wayne's next-to-last Western, but he would end his career in a poignant blaze of glory with ""The Shootist"" (1976)."	2.0	0

med_199605	Unforgivably awful picture and sound quality. The home-made quality of the recording is inexcusable, and at this price, criminal. I have to agree with other reviewers that the canned laughter and warped-sounding theme music are really hard to tolerate. I used to like this program. What on earth was I thinking? It is very silly and funny, but not funny enough to justify the exorbitant price and lousy quality.	2.0	0
med_199606	Although I enjoyed seeing both Ian Mc Kellen and Glen Scott in their early days, I thought it was a waste of talent. The script was lacking. I found it confusing. For example, what's with the romance angle between Scott's character and the daughter. There doesn't seem to have been any point. Also, I never was clear about who, or what Scott's character was. I certainly expected more from this film.	2.0	0

med_199620	I really enjoyed this movie... I thought I'd have a hard time taking Kristen Wiig and Ben Stiller together seriously, but they were both so great in their roles, that I didn't even think about it beyond the first 2 minutes of the film. Very beautiful and interesting photography. Loved the story being told and the twists.	5.0	1
med_199621	The dvd arrived quickly,but I hated this movie! I read the book and it was 100%better than the movie. I have been a lifelong Leo DiCaprio movie fan,but after seeing his performance in the movie I'm very disappointed & I'm no longer a fan of his!	1.0	0
med_199622	Great premise and production but the script was thin on plot, humor & surprises. The trailer showed the best parts and it is sad since Seth McFarlane's performance wasn't bad at all. It just needed more jokes and not to lean so heavily on the jokes that were provided by Neal Patrick Harris' & Giovanni Ribisi's characters. When you are watching and the highlight surprise was a cameo by Dennis Haskins (which was funny) but your not really given much.	2.0	0

med_199657	L.J. Grahams review explains it well. I give a 2 star rather than 3 especially because Fellows tries to compare this to Downton Abbey, and Trollop to Dickens. Boo. Grasping for comparisons with a glaringly higher tier of talent and skill only creates disappointment. I can't even continue watching. I tried, for the beautiful scenery, some good talent, and hope for improvement, but I can't continue because it's so boring and badly written.	2.0	0

med_199673	Being a Marvel fan, I had not heard of this series. Ok the illustration is tacky but its Marvel - it should have something personal, redeeming, adventurous...something - right? The story was VERY slow to develop (and I typically like a good setup). More of the issue was my shock at how nasty the content was. Graphically nothing foul, but the content of dialogue is rotten and displays the worst of how people speak. I was confused how this even came out. Big Thumbs down.	1.0	0
med_199674	I just love this movie! It's about an insecure, unpopular, nice girl who becomes a witch on her 16th birthday. Will she use her powers for good or evil?

You take a drug and suddenly you become omnipotent, almost a god? Sure there are crazy story lines in a lot of movies and the movies are still good because for a while they make you believe in the story. This movie has bad acting and a bad story.

Great morals, great story, great movie, and great ENDING! muahahaha daddy!!	5.0	1

med_199749	"The word ""Know"" implies knowledge and this movie is about irrational belief, not knowledge. Science and reason are used to support religious ideas in the form of New Age only where they can be supportive. The lines of reasoning that conflict with the theology are ignored. The result is a slick series of nonsensical connections."	1.0	0

med_199769	This was money wasted. There are no instructions with the DVD so changing from one mode to another - screensize and sound - is by guess and by golly. I also doubt the claim that this thing is in HD. The picture quality is nowhere near HD. It barely is digital quality.

med_199801	The movie is an okay horror, but the CG versions of the Lycans were too fake looking and detract from the movie's realism. The movie was shot in 3D and looks good on a 3D TV.

med_199817	For movie fans of the original Mad Max films, this film fails to meet the interest standard of the originals.

med_199827	Seeing Orlando Bloom as Legolas again was such a treat. Also a new character, a female elf has been added, but in my opinion it's a wonderful addition that follows nicely with the flow of Tolkien's original story. This character is played by Evangeline Lilly, who played Kate Austen on the ABC series Lost . Loved her work on that series, and her rendition of an elf in Middle Earth is amazing. Simply a joy to watch!	5.0	1

med_199872	So far I have seen 2 of the movies in this set: Design for Living and Peter Ibbetson and was disappointed in both.

I had this on my watchlist and the husband watched it without me so I am just passing the info along he shared. It was awful and he has a pretty darn good taste in movies and we probably watch between 5-8 movies a week so we give even the bad ones a chance. This one was stopped about an hour in.	1.0	0
med_199933	I would have expected something more then just a violent movie, especially considering Washington was in the cast. Unfortunately likely the movie industry is running out of ideas	2.0	0
med_199934	The late Ossie Davis in his last movie roll helps to tell one of many untold stories in the Black military experience. ---ORS	5.0	1
med_199935	i give this film 4 stars because this movie was relatable, tender sweet educational and moving but only 4 because it had a sad ending	4.0	1
med_199936	Not an accurate reflection of the Book of Exodus. I understand Hollywood takes major deviations from the Bible when they make a movie that's related to it but if you watch the movie thinking you will get an unbiased portrayal of the story of the Exodus do not deceive yourself.	1.0	0
med_199937	Quite simple and easy to get started, I spent two 3 yr tours in Germany, loved the country, loved the people and FOOD!!! My daughter was taking German ins school, but the class she transferred into was too advanced for her so I bought these. She learned basic sentence structure and common words - a bib help in her class.	4.0	1
med_199938	I had been waiting on this for some time now! All the movies in one place. The quality of the transfer is excellent and the movies are classic to say the least. The packaging was nice as well. The open space for Skyfall (not out when I purchased it) was a good thought.	5.0	1
med_199939	This was lousy. Maybe I'm just to technical. But this movie was blah! I would never watch it again, even on the TV.	1.0	0
med_199940	She's a good teacher, she even has some videos online that can be viewed via youtube; I just couldn't get into this dvd.	1.0	0
med_199941	I really enjoyed the series. The experts team is awesome and some of the tasks are shocking. I will totally buy the next season!	4.0	1
med_199942	It took me forever to plod through this incredibly dull and lackluster series. The original had wit, humor, intelligence and mystery - not to mention the incredible, explosive Patrick MacGoohan in the lead role, and the wonderful fairytale village of Portmeirion. This one had a lot of African sand, all of it falling rather too slowly through the hour (after hour) glass.	1.0	0
med_199943	The Bottom Line: Though Sorry Wrong Number can sometimes feel a little stagebound (its radio origins are often noticable), it's a taut and intriguing thriller which has held up well over the years and can still shock you with its cruel punchline.	4.0	1
med_199944	This PBS mini-series is by far the most comprehensive documentary on the Broadway Musical I have ever seen. Anyone who loves Broadway or plans on becoming an actor should watch. First rate!	5.0	1
med_199946	Only problem is the DVD cannot be played on computers/devices set to american standard. It is en espanol, but great movie	4.0	1
med_199947	My wife and I watched this movie and surprisingly it was good. Funny in certain parts and worth the $4 rental.	4.0	1
med_199948	Decent plot overall, but it was insanely dumb IMHO - not sure what else they could have done with it, but definitely won't be recommending it to anyone.	1.0	0
med_199951	Boring. I could not get through the first half hour of the movie. I am glad I was able to view it through prime, if I had to pay for this movie I would have been upset	1.0	0
med_199952	We love the new annimated Thomas series! It gives the characters a more natural feel! All the trains, conductors and even Sir Topom Hat all talk! Much more entertaing! My one year old just loves this too! Old and New fans will love the change. Highly Recommend.	4.0	1
med_199953	This movie was not good at all. Not only was it depressing, but the filming was low quality. I wish that I never watched it.	1.0	0
med_199954	Fine film- lots of special effects and a predictable but enjoyable ending.	5.0	1
med_199955	Such a promising cast and premise, but it just spins almost immediately beyond a parody of the outrageous contemporary American political theater into self parody.	2.0	0
med_199956	I was disappointed that it was like all the others with too much focus on her private sex life rather than good history. This one was more boring so I didn't get through the whole thing.	2.0	0
med_199957	Received it in the mail and was missing the first disc. Had to return it.	1.0	0
med_199958	Stopped 1/2 way through the movie, because there wasn't enough to hold my interest, or fear-factor.	2.0	0
med_199960	Interesting premise, really weak delivery. This move was like someone's random thought, blown up into a full length movie that no one could figure out what do do with. Kind of frustrating to watch when there were opportunities for some interesting twists that the writers et al didn't pick up on. Skip it.	2.0	0
med_199961	This movie was horrible. The premise was stupid, the acting was terrible and I would not recommend it to anyone.	1.0	0
med_199962	"All of the social dynamics and high style of ""Downton Abbey"" compressed into a movie, and more beautifully orchestrated. If you can catch the DVD issue with commentaries by both Julian Fellowes and by Robert Altman, please do so - both are illuminating in surprising ways. It rewards multiple viewings - almost demands them! - and they're all fun and, then, increasingly moving. This is one for your library."	5.0	1
med_199963	This is a very rare film, and somewhat of a cult item. Right out of 1973 Robert Blake takes to the road with his Harley Electro-Glide...you are in for a 70s treat my friends...popcorn night right here!	5.0	1
med_199964	Pretty good perspective in the eyes of different people on the rapture!	4.0	1
med_199965	Hot Damn!!! This is Brigette at her best! I could watch her fold laundry for hours & hours! These are great movies though. Order this set! You will not be disappointed!	5.0	1
med_199967	Do not waste your time on this one. Very weak sequel. Weak, weak, weak. Worst of all the Resident Evil's.	2.0	0
med_199968	A excellent plot - a look at how one must find their own destiny and not choose to take the easy way out. Enjoyable by the entire family.	5.0	1
med_199970	A little intense and probably over the top creep level for todays generation, I'm sure they'll come around to see the importance of this cinematic mind twig snapper.	5.0	1
med_199971	"The most awesome anti-fairy tale series is out as a Blu Ray set. I couldn't have asked for anything cooler. Anyone sick of hearing that accursed ""Let It Go"" from Frozen everywhere they go? Well this is the perfect antidote. Watch this, and laugh your butt off... I just ordered the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Blu Ray Movie Collection with this, and I think the family is about to have a back to back awesome green hero marathon!!!"	5.0	1
med_199972	if your a teen this may be amusing, otherwise move along	1.0	0
med_199973	This was a very moving video. Happy for the ending!!	5.0	1
med_199974	A must see if you are watching the series. It connects the two seasons. Action packed and enjoyable to watch. Just wish they hadn't felt the need to add a few cuss words because it was in the theaters.	4.0	1
med_199975	Item Shipped Quickly, As Described, Very Good Value, Good Overall Experience, Would Recommend to All of My Friends and Family.	5.0	1
med_199977	This production is genuinely creepy on a low budget. The Federator's son does a good job of being completely unlikeable.	4.0	1
med_199978	It was okay.....just seem so edited...They showed us what we already know ....their was no surprises about her life...okay one ...but that's it...	2.0	0
med_199979	I was very pleasantly surprised. I thought Nicklaus Cage was washed up. But he pulled this one out out of his ass for a great performance.	4.0	1
med_199980	Nicely done sitcom. One can imagine that this craziness really happens in the congressional halls of D.C.	5.0	1
med_199981	I have seen bowl movements better than this movie. horrible, terrible lack of imgination a real $%^& movie. It hurt my eyes and head watching this piss poor excuse for a movie	1.0	0
med_199982	Great little snack bag for my daughter for preschool ! But not much more. It is certainly not big enough for a whole lunch. But great for a small juice box, and snack baggie . Or maybe just putting small toys in. The only issue I have had with this is the zipper gets stuck pretty often which is frustrating for my daughter. So it is a bit cheaply made, but worth it for the movies inside.	4.0	1
med_199983	Blake Lively was the best part of this movie for me lol everything else was a little depressing I said it before and ill say it again , this to me was almost the same as the green hornet ryan reynolds and seth rogen both good actors but had horrible characters to play in these movies	2.0	0
med_199985	Almost a good movie, but it does show a negative view of life (lack of hope, selfish motive to die, no zest for life in face of adversity). Not a good model for society.	2.0	0
med_199986	The person speaking in this documentary was difficult to understand since there was background noise going on during the entire documentary and the person speaking was drowned out by this noise. I wish I hadn't bought it.	1.0	0
med_199987	Too much political correctness. Horribly disappointing compared to the other two seasons.	2.0	0
med_199990	"Yeah, bleah. The best way I can put to words my feelings about this movie is to say ""bleah."" It's sorta not ever funny or interesting. It's sorta not ever watchable or entertaining. It's just bleah. I'm also not sure why the female costumes were so scant and revealing, it is supposed to be a kids' film. Sticking with ""bleah"""	2.0	0
med_199991	Killing off a key character (Gideon Spillet, the journalist) who added so much to the original story had me turning off the movie after only a few minutes. After butchering the beginning, there was nowhere to go but down the tubes.	1.0	0
med_199992	I rememer watching this movie 30 years ago and I thought it was pretty bad then and that it was just a Spielberg money maker. I couldn't believe Speilberg could make Jaws, Indiana Jones, CE3K, Schindler's List, and then attach his name to this crap. This movie isn't just bad it's bad in all movie ways including technically, pacing, screenplay, especially the screenplay...how in the world did this ever make it to the big screen?...of wait, Speilberg.	1.0	0
med_199993	We only watched for a short time. Talented people but rather boring as a film. Not much of a story either.	2.0	0
med_199994	This was a slow movie that didn't give enough background about the characters. I thought it was also listed under comedy, it is not a comedy	2.0	0
med_199995	It was something to pass the time of day, but it was pretty corny. The acting was marginal as best.	2.0	0
med_199996	A very engaging series, as long as you keep in mind that the basic premise of 'aliens among us' is rather far fetched. Having said that, the series is well made from a production standpoint and is sure to keep the kids occupied for quite some time!	4.0	1
med_199997	THE COLOR QAULITY & DEPTH OF THESE MOVIES WAS GREAT THE STORY LINE FOR THESE MOVIES WAS OVERALL GREAT AND FUNNY	5.0	1
med_199998	I saw this movie maybe 20 years ago. It left such an impression the first time, I had to add it to my collection so I could view and share it with others at any time	4.0	1
med_199999	Excellent movie! Something that you would love to watch plenty of action. Give you a little bit of movie history on Pablo. I would watch this again. My wife and I enjoyed it.	4.0	1
